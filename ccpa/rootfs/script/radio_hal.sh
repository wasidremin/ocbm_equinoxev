# radio_hal.sh - the chipset-neutral radio seam. Everything above this line (session_supervisor,
# the Rust daemons) asks for "wifi up" / "bt up" and never names a chip, a module, a firmware
# path or an attach helper.
#
# VERBS   probe | status | wifi_ap_on | wifi_ap_off | bt_on | bt_off | sco_on
# EXIT    0 converged now   1 ran and failed   2 already converged   3 unsupported on this unit
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THE VERB AND SCRIPT NAMES LOOK LIKE THIS. session_supervisor's teardown runs inside a
# detached `sh -c` whose own argv is visible to its own pkill patterns. That is a real bug this
# project already paid for once (2026-08-01: a plain `pkill -f` SIGKILLed the teardown subshell
# before it reached wlan_off, orphaning hostapd, which kept beaconing). So the name of this
# script and every verb MUST avoid the substrings the supervisor pattern-matches on:
# carplayd, btd, ocbmd, hostapd. Do not rename a verb without
# re-checking every pgrep/pkill pattern in session_supervisor.sh.
#
# THREE CONTRACT CLAUSES, each bought with a real failure:
#
#   1. CONVERGENT ON RETURN, NEVER FORK-AND-RETURN. When an `_on` verb returns 0, the radio is
#      up AND RESPONSIVE, and no work this verb started is still in flight. The vendor's own
#      dispatcher violates this (`/script/attach_bluetooth.sh &`, and the Broadcom branch
#      backgrounds brcm_patchram_plus) - that is precisely the uncoordinated double-bring-up
#      docs/wireless/01_BT_AND_RADIO.md recorded fighting itself for 7+ minutes on real hardware, because the caller
#      exec'd its advertiser while attach was still mid-retry. Callers rely on the return.
#
#   2. RESPONSIVENESS, NOT EXISTENCE. `hci0` can appear ~100ms after attach with firmware that
#      never loaded, and every later command then times out (docs/wireless/01_BT_AND_RADIO.md). Convergence is a real HCI
#      round-trip - read the local name back under a timeout - not a node existence test. The
#      vendor's check is `hciconfig hci0` existence, which a dead chip passes.
#
#   3. NEVER REBOOT, NEVER TOUCH SESSION DAEMONS. The vendor SD8987 branch can reboot the box
#      from inside a radio bring-up; that would bypass session_supervisor's escalation ladder
#      and its persistent reboot budget. A backend that believes only a reboot can recover says
#      so with an exit code and lets the layer that owns reboot policy decide. Likewise this
#      script never signals carplayd / btd / ocbmd: it cannot know
#      whether a live session is wired-owned, and the supervisor's conditional-reap logic
#      (docs/wireless/00_WIRELESS_CARPLAY.md #1.4) exists exactly to make that distinction.
#
# WHAT WE TAKE FROM CARLINKIT AND WHAT WE DO NOT. radio_detect.sh extracts this unit's own
# insmod/attach command lines from its own vendor dispatcher. Those lines are the vendor's
# OBSERVATIONS - fleet-deployed, working, and not re-derivable by us for parts we do not own -
# so we run them verbatim. Their surrounding control flow is their CHOICE, and it carries the
# defects above, so we supply our own. We never execute init_bluetooth_wifi.sh wholesale.
#
# THE AP LAYER IS ALWAYS OURS. Never delegate it. On a stripped box the vendor's
# start_bluetooth_wifi.sh reads config through riddleBoxCfg, which the OCBM base removes; with
# it gone that script seds an EMPTY wpa_passphrase into /etc/hostapd.conf - persistent, on
# flash - and falls back to WLANIP=192.168.50.2, which is NCM's own address, then repoints the
# DHCP pool onto the NCM subnet. Its teardown killalls every udhcpd, including NCM's. That is
# the control channel you are standing on.

# Single-flight per subsystem. mkdir is the portable atomic test-and-set on busybox (no flock
# dependency). A concurrent second bring-up must not run - the supervisor can manufacture
# overlapping edges (a respawn synthesizes a host-present edge), and stacking two insmod/rmmod
# sequences on one module is the driver-wedge class this guards against.
#
# A lock MUST be reclaimable. An earlier version had no staleness handling and no trap: a killed
# invocation (an ssh session timing out mid-bring-up is enough) left the directory behind and
# every later call refused to run, so wireless could never come up again until reboot. A lock is
# an optimisation against stacking, never a way to permanently disable a radio.
# RECLAIM ON LIVENESS, NOT ON AGE. The first version aged locks out after 2 minutes, which is
# SHORTER THAN A LEGITIMATE bt_on: against a present-but-wedged controller the convergence poll
# calls a `timeout 5` probe up to 30 times per attempt, across 4 attempts, so a genuine bring-up
# can hold the lock for many minutes. A concurrent caller would then declare the LIVE holder
# stale, delete its lock, and start a second attach against the same UART - which is exactly the
# OP_H5_SYNC collision the lock exists to prevent, manufactured by the lock itself.
#
# So the holder records its PID and reclaim requires the holder to be GONE. The age check stays

# disagree: on the validated unit the WLAN MAC and the BT controller address share no octets at

# from Wi-Fi and ccpa-CCDD from Bluetooth. So which name a radio gets would depend on which radio
# happened to be up when it was asked — and in the BT-only bridge role (wifi_ap:false) the WLAN

# SCO (HFP call audio). Re-apply THIS UNIT'S OWN post-attach SCO setup.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE VERB. `btd`'s `bt_bringup::bring_up` forces a DOWN->UP cycle on the
# controller (it is the only way the kernel re-sends its Set_Event_Mask, without which SSP pairing
# silently never reaches the host). This controller is hciattach'd over UART, so it carries
# HCI_QUIRK_RESET_ON_CLOSE and that `down` issues a real HCI_Reset -- discarding everything
# attach_bluetooth.sh set after ITS attach, the SCO setup included. For as long as nothing carried
# audio over SCO that was a documented, harmless side effect. Wireless Android Auto carries call
# and Assistant audio over HFP/SCO, so it is now a real fault, and the daemon calls this verb after
# every bring-up.
#
# The commands are the VENDOR'S, extracted per-branch by radio_detect.sh -- never composed here.
# On this unit's Realtek branch the vendor sets ONLY the SCO MTU and no routing command at all

      #     and still be wedged (name read times out), so re-attaching is right - but the stale
      #     helper still holds /dev/ttymxc2 and the new H5 SYNC collides with the old link state
      #     ("OP_H5_SYNC Transmission timeout" -> "Retransmission exhausts"), leaving the chip
      #     deader than before.
      #  2. Killing the helper is not enough: the line-discipline MODULE holds the stale H5 state.
      #     Both the vendor's reset_bluetooth() and our own reset_bt() rmmod it before the reset,
      #     and a reset without that step does not revive the chip - measured.
      #  3. The reset line is asserted HIGH then released LOW (1 -> 0). Both implementations agree;
      #     driving it the other way is a no-op that looks like a reset in the log.
