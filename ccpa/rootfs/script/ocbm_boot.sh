# ocbm_boot.sh - boot the host-facing gadget as a PURE OCBM accessory, launch ocbmd, and start the
# session supervisor (IDLE). Runs from start_main_service.sh when neither ncm_only nor ncm_wifi is set
# (the OCBM appliance default). Backgrounds all work + exit 0 so it can never block boot; UART
# early-console remains the recovery path. Uses bDeviceClass=0 (NOT 239) so the host sees a clean single
# vendor interface, not an IAD composite (which macOS seizes). Binaries are FHS-installed (/usr/sbin).
########################
# SYNCHRONOUS, and deliberately OUTSIDE the subshell below: runMainProcess skips ARMadb only if
# this flag exists by the time start_main_service.sh reaches it (~line 74). We are invoked at its
# line 19 and return immediately, so anything we background is racing those ~55 lines. It used to
# be set inside the subshell *after* a `tar -xzf`, i.e. the race could be lost on a slow unpack --
# and losing it means ARMadb starts, clobbers our accessory gadget, and the host sees a SECOND
# enumeration with a DIFFERENT identity. Hosts that key a USB permission grant on the descriptors
# (Android) treat that as a different device. One touch, one identity, one enumeration.

  # ---- FIRST-BOOT DEAD-MAN (armed by ocbm_install.sh finalize: /script/ocbm_trial) --------
  # The installer tells the operator: "if this host does not confirm over the OCBM link within
  # 240s, the box restores ncm_only and reboots itself back to NCM." That promise was made by
  # the host and implemented NOWHERE - the flag was written and cleared host-side and no box
  # code ever read it. On a unit with no UART, a first boot where the OCBM stack does not come
  # up therefore had no way back at all: no NCM, no OCBM, and a finalize message telling the
  # operator to wait for a rescue that could never arrive. This is that rescue.
  #
  # It is deliberately SEPARATE from the failover watchdog below. That one asks "is our stack
  # healthy?" and only runs when opted into; this one asks "did a human confirm they can still
  # reach this box?" and runs exactly once, on the boot that flipped the default. A stack can
  # look perfectly healthy from the inside while being unreachable from the outside - wrong
  # gadget descriptors, a host that cannot claim the interface, a cable that never enumerates -
  # and only an outside acknowledgement can distinguish those.
  #
  # One-shot by construction: the confirm removes the flag, and a revert creates ncm_only, so
  # the box boots NCM and stays there until a human decides otherwise. A timed-out trial can
  # never become a reboot loop.

  # ---- NCM FAILOVER WATCHDOG (opt-in: /script/ocbm_failover) ------------------------------
  # On a unit with no UART, OCBM-as-default is the only door. If the OCBM stack cannot come up
  # at all, this drops /script/ncm_only and reboots, so the box returns to NCM with ssh/telnet
  # on 192.168.50.2 instead of being unreachable.
  #
  # WHAT COUNTS AS FAILURE — both triggers mean OUR OWN STACK is broken:
  #   1. /dev/usb_accessory never appears: the accessory gadget never bound, so ocbmd has
  #      nothing to open. Nothing downstream can work.
  #   2. ocbmd will not stay running: repeatedly dead across the observation window, i.e. the
  #      inittab respawn is churning rather than holding.
  #
  # WHAT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COUNT: no host talking to us. The gadget sitting at CONNECTED,
  # or CONFIGURED with silence on the wire, is the NORMAL state of an appliance in a car or on
  # a bench. Treating that as failure would make the box flap between modes every time it is
  # powered without a host, which is worse than either mode on its own. ocbmd exiting ONCE on
  # a host disconnect is also normal — that is what the respawn wrapper is for — hence a count,
  # not a single miss.
  #
  # It is one-shot by construction: once /script/ncm_only exists the box boots NCM and stays
  # there until a human removes it, so a persistent fault cannot become a reboot loop.
