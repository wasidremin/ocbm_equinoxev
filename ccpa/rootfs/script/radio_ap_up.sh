# radio_ap_up.sh - the OWNED SoftAP layer. Chipset-neutral by construction: it loads no driver,
# names no module, reads no firmware tree. It configures hostapd + udhcpd on whatever interface
# the seam hands it, and returns only once the AP is actually up.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS UNDER THIS NAME. Every CCPA already ships a VENDOR file at
# /script/start_bluetooth_wifi.sh, so testing that path for existence proves the file is there,
# not that it is ours - and running the vendor copy on a stripped box is destructive:
#
#   * it reads config through `riddleBoxCfg`, which the OCBM base install removes, and the calls
#     are NOT existence-guarded. With it gone `passwd` comes back empty and the script seds an
#     EMPTY wpa_passphrase into /etc/hostapd.conf. That is persistent, on flash, and hostapd
#     refuses to start with a zero-length WPA passphrase - so the AP is broken for every future
#     bring-up, not just this one.
#   * its WLANIP default is 192.168.50.2 - the box's OWN NCM address - and it then repoints the
#     DHCP pool at 192.168.50.100-200, which is the pool the NCM link is handing out. On a unit
#     with no UART that is the control channel you are standing on.
#   * its teardown (`close_bluetooth_wifi.sh`) does `EnsureProcessKill udhcpd`, a killall that
#     takes the NCM DHCP server down with it.
#
# An unambiguous name is the guard. radio_hal.sh calls THIS path and explicitly refuses to fall
# back to the vendor one. Do not "simplify" that by pointing the seam at start_bluetooth_wifi.sh.
#
# WHAT IS CHIPSET-NEUTRAL HERE. The interface name arrives in RADIO_WLAN_IF (radio_hal.sh
# enumerates it - it is an insmod parameter, not a constant: Realtek if2name=sta0, Broadcom
# iface_name=sta, and on Broadcom wlan0 does not exist until something creates it on top of
# sta0). The device-unique SSID is derived from that interface's own MAC in sysfs rather than
# from the vendor's `set_wifi_mac` output, so no vendor helper is required.
#
# USAGE  RADIO_WLAN_IF=<iface> sh radio_ap_up.sh [AP]

# ---- device-unique name ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# ccpa-<last 4 hex of the AP interface MAC>, matching the BT name so one box presents one
# identity on both radios. Falls back to the serial when the MAC is unreadable. Read from sysfs,
# not from `set_wifi_mac`, so this works on a unit where that vendor helper was stripped.
#
# THIS OVERWRITES ssid= IN /etc/hostapd.conf, AND THAT IS ONLY SAFE BECAUSE OF WHO CALLS US.
# In the BT-only bridge role (wifi_ap:false — the GM head-unit deployment, where the adapter is
# just the Bluetooth radio and the MFi coprocessor) that same file holds the VEHICLE's ssid,
# written by the supervisor's apply_host_wifi_creds(), and it is what the box hands the phone in
# the iAP2 0x5703 handoff. Clobbering it there would point the phone at an AP that is never
# raised — a documented, session-killing failure that also poisons the next attempt.
# We are safe only because session_supervisor skips wifi_ap_on entirely when BOX_WIFI_AP=0.
# So: do NOT make radio_hal call this verb unconditionally, and do NOT "fix" the supervisor's
# wifi_ap:false branch to fall through to here.
# The seam resolves the identity once and passes it in, so the SSID and the Bluetooth name come

# the same persisted /etc/carplay_ident first, so the two paths cannot diverge.

# refusal is a literal string match while the kernel parses the address numerically. inet_aton()
# reads a leading-zero octet as OCTAL and an 0x octet as HEX, so `192.168.062.1` and
