# session_supervisor.sh — docs/carplay/02_SESSION_LIFECYCLE.md lifecycle state-machine ACTOR (box side). Launched at boot by
# ocbm_boot.sh and then IDLE-WAITS: post-boot the box does nothing to the phone until a HOST APP
# commands it. It reads ocbmd's presence signal /tmp/host_present and:
#
#   host PRESENT (1) -> go projection-ready + ARM:
#        projection_up.sh (iAP2 handshake -> Identified, if not already) THEN carplayd (which now
#        carries mDNS discovery in-process; the separate rx-connect binary was merged into it 2026-09-08).
#   host GONE   (0) -> TEARDOWN: kill carplayd -> HOLDING PATTERN (iap2d stays up).
#
# ocbmd supplies the one grace before it ever moves the flag: HEARTBEAT_GRACE=10s (beat loss), in
# ccpa/ocbmd/src/main.rs; a blip inside it never reaches here. A clean CT_STOP gets NO grace (changed
# 2026-09-03, was STOP_GRACE=5s) — it drops the flag at once so this loop runs a full teardown. Since
# we sample at 1 Hz and act on EDGES, ocbmd holds that 0 for REARM_HOLD=2s before honouring a
# re-SUBSCRIBE, so a quit->relaunch inside one tick cannot hide the GONE edge from us.
# NOTE: this file defines no heartbeat constant of its own — it is edge-triggered on the flag.
#
# P0 lifecycle hardening (docs/carplay/02_SESSION_LIFECYCLE.md,§2 — tasks #22,#23): the supervisor no longer treats "carplayd
# process alive" as healthy. It derives a real HEALTH signal from establishment milestones in
# carplayd.log (pair-verify OK -> RECORD = Apple's "session established" edge), publishes it to
# /tmp/session_healthy, and tracks STUCK counters (establishment stalls + presence flaps) that SURVIVE
# teardown and reset only after a session has been confirmed-established for a hold period. This closes
# the docs/carplay/02_SESSION_LIFECYCLE.md stall, where "ARMED + carplayd-alive" masked a session that never streamed and the one
# counter was wiped by teardown() on every GONE edge. The phone_reset escalation LADDER that ACTS on
# health=STUCK lands in task #24; here we detect, publish, bound the retry, and log the verdict.
#
# BENCH LEVER (2026-09-03): if /tmp/carplay_btmon exists (or CARPLAY_BTMON=1) AND `btmon` is on
# PATH, wireless_up() starts `btmon` for the wireless session's HCI traffic, prefixed "[btmon] "
# into /tmp/box.log, and wireless_down() kills it at teardown. Opt-in and harmless when btmon is
# absent (unknown on the CCPA rootfs) -- see btmon_start()/the "[b]tmon" pkill lines.

# regardless) — this only ADDS the wireless option alongside it, so the box waits for whichever transport
# connects FIRST (dual-transport, first-come-wins; the wireless_owns_session guards above keep them from
# fighting). The heavy bring-up (~15 s: WiFi/BT module loads) runs DETACHED so it never blocks the 1 s
# loop, and each stage is internally idempotent (wlan_on/bt_on skip if already loaded; btd
# is pgrep-guarded). NEVER pipe a radio bring-up script to tail/head — a backgrounding daemon inheriting
# the console PTY wedges it; always redirect to a logfile.
