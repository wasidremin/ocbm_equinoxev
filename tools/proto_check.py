"""Check every OCBM client against the canonical constant table.

`crates/ocbm-proto/src/lib.rs` is the protocol. Every other implementation -- the macOS Swift
client, the CarlinkAndroid Kotlin client, and gm_ccpa's own Kotlin client -- restates those
constants by hand in its own language, and nothing has ever verified that the restatements agree. They did not: CT_PROJ_MODE, CT_BOX_HEALTH, the BH_* health bits, F_REPLAY and the whole
CH_FILE opcode set reached the box and the gm_ccpa client while this repo's own Kotlin and Swift
clients never learned them (found 2026-08-31).

A value that disagrees is a wire bug: two endpoints of one link mean different things by the same
byte. That is an ERROR here. A constant a client simply does not define yet is drift, not a bug
today -- reported as a gap, and an error only for the CORE set (channel ids, CT_* opcodes, frame
flags), which every client must be able to name even where it does not act on the opcode.

Usage:  tools/proto_check.py [--strict]
        --strict  treat every gap as an error, not just the core set.

All three clients live in this repo and are always checked. Until 2026-09-11 gm_ccpa was covered
only when its root was passed as an argument -- and then only by accident, because its OcbmProto.kt
was a symlink into CarlinkAndroid's copy, so the "third client" was the second one read twice. The
file is now an app-owned fork, so it is a real third client and it is in CLIENTS. A positional path
is rejected rather than ignored: the only thing it could name is a second checkout, i.e. exactly the
stale copy the fork exists to stop anyone checking by mistake.
