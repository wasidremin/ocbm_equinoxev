#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ocbm_install.sh — install OCBM onto an adapter sitting at the NCM base, and prove it works
# before making it the default.
#
# STARTING POINT: the NCM base produced by tools/ncm_base_install.sh — Carlinkit stack gone,
# owned boot path, `/script/ncm_only` set, root shell at 192.168.50.2 over USB-NCM.
#
# ============================== THE SHAPE OF THE PROBLEM ===============================
# `ci_hdrc.1` is a SINGLE-FUNCTION gadget: `functions=ncm` OR `functions=accessory`, never
# both. NCM is what carries telnet/dropbear, so arming OCBM takes the control channel away.
# On a unit with no UART wired that makes "switch to OCBM" a one-way door.
#
# So this script never switches anything it has not first proven it can switch back from:
#
#   1. place     files pushed over NCM. Nothing about the boot path changes, so the adapter
#                still boots NCM no matter what happens here.
#   2. verify    md5 of every placed file against the host, exec bits, `sh -n` the scripts.
#   3. reboot    cold boot, still on NCM — proves placing the files broke nothing.
#   4. trial     TEMPORARY switch to accessory with a dead-man timer that reboots back to NCM
#                on its own. The host then does the OCBM handshake and opens a root console.
#                Whether that succeeds or fails, the adapter returns to NCM by itself.
#   5. finalize  only now, and only if you say so: make OCBM the boot default. Even that is
#                armed with `/script/ocbm_trial`, a first-boot dead-man that restores
#                `ncm_only` and reboots unless the host confirms over the OCBM link.
#
# Every irreversible-looking step is therefore preceded by the same step done reversibly.
#
# ============================== WHY THE TRIAL LOOKS LIKE IT DOES =======================
# Two things were learned the hard way on 2026-08-15 and are baked in here:
#
#  * WAIT FOR `CONFIGURED`, NOT FOR THE DEVICE NODE. `/dev/usb_accessory` appears ~100 ms
#    after the function binds, long before the host has enumerated. Starting ocbmd there gets
#    `accessory POLLHUP/POLLERR — USB transport gone; exiting for respawn` and the trial dies
#    at once.
#  * BOUNCE THE PULLUP AFTER CHANGING FUNCTIONS. Going from an `ncm` composite straight to a
#    vendor accessory leaves the host holding the old configuration: the box reports
#    CONNECTED (VBUS) but never CONFIGURED, and nothing appears in `ioreg`/`lsusb`.
#
# ============================== USAGE ==================================================
#   tools/ocbm_install.sh preflight
#   tools/ocbm_install.sh all              # place → verify → reboot → trial → ask
#   tools/ocbm_install.sh trial            # re-run just the reversible switch test
#   tools/ocbm_install.sh finalize         # make OCBM the default (asks first)
#   tools/ocbm_install.sh revert           # put ncm_only back, reboot
#
# Options:
#   --host IP     adapter address (default 192.168.50.2 — .100 is usually YOUR lease)
#   --full        also install the projection stack (iap2d, carplayd,
#                 btd, session_supervisor.sh, projection_up.sh). Default is the
#                 minimal set: ocbmd + ocbm_boot.sh, which is all CONSOLE/FILE management needs
#   --ttl N       trial dead-man timeout in seconds (default 600)
#   --run-dir DIR where reports land
#   --yes         skip prompts (the finalize prompt included — think first)

  The adapter is at the NCM base with OCBM installed and PROVEN (handshake + root console),
  and it is currently booting NCM. Two ways to leave it:

    [1] LEAVE IT ON NCM  (default, reversible)
        Boots to NCM every time; telnet/ssh at $BOX. OCBM stays installed and you can run
        'tools/ocbm_install.sh trial' whenever you want it, with the same dead-man.

    [2] MAKE OCBM THE DEFAULT
        Removes /script/ncm_only, so start_main_service runs ocbm_boot.sh and the adapter
        comes up as an OCBM accessory. NCM/telnet will NOT be there — management moves to
        'ocbm-host console'. First boot is armed with /script/ocbm_trial: if this host does
        not confirm over the OCBM link within 240s, the box restores ncm_only and reboots
        itself back to NCM.
