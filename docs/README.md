# Documentation map

**One topic, one file. Correct it in place.** Adding a new dated document instead of fixing the
owning one is what produced the 66-file corpus this replaced (consolidated 2026-08-31); the
originals live in git history and in the `ccpa_custom_2026-08-31` backup.

Rules that keep it that way:

1. **≤10 files per category directory.** `tools/docs_check.py` fails the build if a category exceeds
   it. If a topic needs a new file, something else must merge first.
2. **Corrections go inline**, at the claim they correct, with the date and the evidence. Do not open
   a `*_CORRECTIONS`/`*_V2`/`*_<DATE>` sibling.
3. **Historical material stays inside its owner** under a `HISTORICAL` heading, or is dropped —
   git remembers it either way.
4. Anything genuinely dead is deleted, not left as a file a skimming reader can land on.

`docs/43`, `docs/49` → carplay/03 · `docs/27`, `docs/62`, `docs/23`, `docs/52` → carplay/06 ·
`docs/20_WIRELESS`, `docs/29–39` → wireless/00 · `docs/40`, `docs/41`, `docs/51`, `docs/57` →
wireless/01 · `docs/60` → androidauto/00+01, `docs/61` → androidauto/02 (both moved out of host/02 on 2026-08-31 when Android Auto got its own category) · `docs/25`, `docs/48`, `docs/50` → ops/05 ·
`REVISIONS.md` → ops/06. Full map: the `<!-- absorbed: … -->` marker at the head of every section.
