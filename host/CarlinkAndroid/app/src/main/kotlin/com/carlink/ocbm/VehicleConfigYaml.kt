/**
 * The vehicle config pushed on `CT_SUBSCRIBE`.
 *
 * ## Why this file is dangerous out of proportion to its size
 *
 * A malformed document does not fail loudly. serde rejects the WHOLE document and the box falls back to
 * its compiled defaults — 1920x720, H.264, `wired_pcm`, the baseline metadata tier — and nothing tells
 * the host. Video simply comes up at the wrong resolution with HEVC off.
 *
 * That is a recorded incident, not a hypothetical: `tools/regen_app_yaml_fixture.py:1-14` describes a
 * hand-typed fixture certifying a broken emitter because one Swift literal lacked a trailing newline,
 * gluing the next key onto `drawUIOutsideSafeArea: false` and "silently revert[ing] resolution, HEVC,
 * appDrivenSetup, audio and the metadata tier at once."
 *
 * So: the shape below is byte-derived from the schema fixture `APP_DOC` in
 * `crates/vendor/receiver/tests/r4_c2_schema.rs:20-103`, and `VehicleConfigYamlTest` pins the rendered
 * output byte for byte. **If you edit the emitter, update the golden test in the same commit** — a
 * fixture nobody regenerates is hand-typed by definition, which is exactly how the incident happened.
 *
 * ## Values that are load-bearing
 *
 * - `touchScreenMode: High Fidelty` — Apple's own misspelling. Matched literally, unquoted.
 * - `primaryInput: Touchpad` — Apple's configs only ever use `Touchpad` or `Knobs`. `Touchscreen`
 *   appears nowhere in their bundle and a strict decoder would throw on it.
 * - `dPadSupport: false` — touch still binds (it rides the `hidDevices[]` Digitizer, not the D-Pad).
 *   Advertising a HID device we do not serve has broken session reconnect before, so every unused
 *   input device stays false. The cost is that `INPUT_NAV` becomes a box-side no-op.
 * - `enablesMainBufferedAudio: false` — advertising a buffered stream we do not serve silences
 *   wireless media entirely.
 * - `wireless: true` — this build uses the adapter's own radios, which is also why the negotiated media
 *   format is AAC-LC 48 kHz stereo (`preset: wireless_8`) rather than the wired PCM path.

     * tier at once:
     *
     *  1. `"` and `\` must be escaped. An unescaped `"` closes the scalar early. An unescaped `\` is
     *     worse than it looks — `\s` is an invalid escape and fails loudly, but `\b` is a *valid* one
     *     and silently yields a backspace, corrupting the value with no error at all.
     *  2. **Cc control characters are rejected at the YAML stream level, which no escaping here can
     *     fix.** They must be STRIPPED, not escaped.
     *
     * The stripped set is Cc only — C0 (`0x00`-`0x1F`), DEL and C1 (`0x7F`-`0x9F`) — matching the

     * comment records the set as verified codepoint-by-codepoint against the box's own `serde_yaml` 0.9
     * and libyaml rather than reasoned about.
     *
     * Two deliberate properties, both easy to "fix" back into a bug:
     *  - The set is a SUPERSET of what the parser strictly rejects. Tab, LF, CR and NEL parse fine —
     *    they fold to spaces — but these are single-line display fields where a folded newline is never
     *    what the user meant, so they go too. Do not narrow it to the truly fatal list.
     *  - **Cf is preserved.** Every format character (ZWJ, ZWSP, soft hyphen, LRM/RLM, BOM) parses
     *    fine, and stripping them silently mangles real content — an emoji ZWJ sequence collapses into
     *    separate glyphs, an RTL label reorders. Do not reach for a blanket control-plus-format test.
     *
     * Escaping each character in one pass also sidesteps the ordering hazard the Swift documents:
     * with chained replacements, backslash must be escaped before quote or the quote pass
     * double-escapes the backslashes the first pass introduced.
