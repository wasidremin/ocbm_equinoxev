/**
 * The non-media half of CarPlay audio: phone calls, Siri, alerts and navigation.
 *
 * `:9003` multiplexes every non-media stream onto one socket. Each access unit is tagged
 * `[rate u32 BE][ch u16 BE][atype u8][codec u8][len u32 BE][AU]` ([VoiceTag]), where `atype` is
 * the CarPlay purpose — 0 media, 1 telephony, 2 speechRecognition, 3 alert, 4 default,
 * 5 compatibility. That byte is the whole basis for routing: telephony, speechRecognition and the
 * Siri `default` downlink are ALL negotiated as AAC-ELD 16 kHz mono, so without it they are
 * byte-for-byte indistinguishable and call audio would land on the assistant output — wrong volume
 * group, wrong ducking, and a call whose volume the user cannot adjust.
 *
 * `codec` is what the sink DECODES WITH, and it is branched on, never assumed:
 *  - [SeamCrypto.CODEC_AAC_ELD] — wireless CarPlay voice; MediaCodec with the ELD ASC.
 *  - [SeamCrypto.CODEC_PCM] — S16 **little-endian** (the seam normalises endianness): the HFP
 *    narrowband call downlink (8 kHz mono, `SEAM_PKT_PLAIN`), the seam's own mSBC decode output
 *    (16 kHz mono), and wired CarPlay's PCM voice streams. Written straight to the track.
 *  - anything else is dropped with a diagnostic naming it. A non-ELD stream fed to an ELD decoder
 *    is garbage or a codec exception per access unit, and that used to be the silent default.
 *
 * Phone-call audio of every flavour lands on [Purpose.CALL] (`USAGE_VOICE_COMMUNICATION`): the
 * `atype` says telephony, the codec only says how to turn it into samples.
 *
 * Routing is by [AudioAttributes] usage, never by device address: GM's CarAudioService maps
 * usage → context → volume group → bus. See `docs/carplay/06_AV_PIPELINE.md`.
 *
 * @param onAssistant true while Siri is speaking, false once its sink is released.
 *
 * The media track must be **paused**, not merely ducked, for the duration. Decompiled from this head
 * unit (2026-08-12): AAOS `CarVolume` V1 ranks VOICE_COMMAND *below* MUSIC, so the volume knob targets
 * whichever of the two is active — and a ducked player is still an active player. GM layers its own
 * `GMAudioService.VolumeSynchronizer` on top, which retargets a knob-MUSIC event to the active route's
 * group, but only for GM-native sources (`BUS_TCP_PROMPT` and friends). Our Siri route reports
 * `source BUS_VOICE_COMMAND, extSource BUS_EXT_NONE`, which matches no retarget rule. Net effect: every
 * knob tick landed on `groupId 5` (MUSIC) and never once on `groupId 2` (VOICE_COMMAND).
 *
 * Pausing media removes MUSIC from the active set, leaving VOICE_COMMAND as the highest-priority active
 * context — at which point GM's own popup renders it, since its `gm_car_volume_items.xml` already maps
 * usage 16 to the title "voice volume".
