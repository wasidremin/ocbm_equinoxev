/**
 * The OCBM host client — the Kotlin equivalent of `ocbm-host`'s `Link` and the macOS
 * `OCBMClient.swift`, driving any [RawBulkTransport].
 *
 * Bring-up order, which is load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. CT_HELLO, retransmitted until CT_HELLO_ACK arrives. Every other frame is DISCARDED while
 *      waiting — a prior session can leave kernel-buffered A/V frames queued ahead of the ACK.
 *   2. CT_SETTIME immediately. The box has no RTC battery, so its clock is bogus at every boot and
 *      CarPlay's TLS pairing needs a real one.
 *   3. CT_SUBSCRIBE with the config blob. This is the presence latch: `/tmp/host_present` goes to 1
 *      and the box supervisor brings the radios up from that edge. THE APP IS THE IGNITION.
 *   4. CT_HEARTBEAT at 1 Hz. Miss the box's 10 s watchdog and it emits SEV_HOST_GONE, clears its
 *      own `subscribed` flag, and IGNORES further heartbeats until a fresh SUBSCRIBE.
