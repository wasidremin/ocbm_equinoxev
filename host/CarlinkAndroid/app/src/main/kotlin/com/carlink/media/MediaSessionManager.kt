 *
 * THREAD SAFETY
 * [MediaSession] is not inherently thread-safe; [UsbAdapterPlayer] is pinned to the
 * main Looper. [updateMetadata] / [updatePlaybackState] / [setStateStopped] /
 * [setStateConnecting] are called from the USB read thread; [initialize] / [release]
 * from the main/lifecycle thread. All mutations of session + internal dedup state are
 * wrapped in `synchronized(sessionLock)`. UsbAdapterPlayer internally posts state
 * updates back to the main looper before calling [Player.invalidateState].
 *
 * DUAL-CARRIER ALBUM ART (preserved from legacy MediaSessionCompat path)
 * Media3's [MediaMetadata] supports both [MediaMetadata.Builder.setArtworkData]
 * (raw bytes, decoded by the consumer) and [MediaMetadata.Builder.setArtworkUri]
 * (`content://` URI via FileProvider). We populate BOTH:
 * - setArtworkData is the PRIMARY carrier — raw JPEG/PNG bytes from the USB
 *   MEDIA_DATA frame flow straight through (no local decode; Media3 consumers decode
 *   on their side). Guaranteed to render even if the URI path fails.
 * - setArtworkUri is ADDITIVE — only set after [AlbumArtCache.put] confirms the
 *   backing file is on disk. Consumers that prefer URIs (e.g. GM RHMI) pick this up.
 *
 * WHY DUAL CARRIER: GM's GMCarMediaService reads metadata via MediaControllerCompat
 * (gm_apks/GMCarMediaService/sources/c0/g.java:111 new MediaControllerCompat(ctx, token)
 * → getMetadata() at c0/g.java:261). An unresolvable artworkUri can nullify the bundle.
 * Inline bytes guarantee text + art always render.
 *
 * SEEK DEDUP (2000 ms threshold)
 * USB MEDIA_DATA position frames arrive ~60–100 ms apart; ~95% are position-only ticks
 * (CarlinkManager.kt:2441) which AAOS already extrapolates. Dedup pushes to the Player
 * only on play/pause transition or when position drifts >2 s from the extrapolated
 * value. Verified 2026-04-20 POTATO session 154850: all surviving "seek" events are
 * genuine track-changes/scrubs, zero false positives across ~6000 MEDIA_DATA frames.
 *
 * NO EXPLICIT AUDIO ATTRIBUTES / NO setPlaybackToLocal
 * Intentionally do not configure audio attributes on the Player. Committing to
 * `CONTENT_TYPE_MUSIC` (equivalent of the legacy `setPlaybackToLocal`) would hard-route
 * hardware volume keys to the MEDIA volume group on GM AAOS, bypassing the focus-aware
 * fallback for SIRI / PHONE_CALL / navigation-prompt contexts. The default AudioAttributes
 * preserves AAOS focus routing.
 *
 * MEDIA3 SESSION "ACTIVE" STATE (observations as of 2026-05-03; re-verify on upgrade)
 * Media3's [MediaSession] does not expose a public `isActive` API surface. Based on
 * Media3 1.10.0 source as read on 2026-05-03 (around MediaSessionLegacyStub.start()),
 * the platform-side android.media.session.MediaSession.isActive flag appeared to be set
 * to true ONCE inside the session start path, with no observed `setActive(false)` call
 * before session release. Within that observation, Player state and timeline emptiness
 * did not appear to toggle the platform active flag — but this is an internal Media3
 * detail without a public contract guarantee, so re-verify when upgrading Media3.
 *
 * AAOS Media Center / GMCarMediaService / cluster appear to gate "available media source"
 * visibility on a combination of (a) session metadata payload and (b) playlist (timeline)
 * presence — both of which ARE driven by [Player.State]. Empirical mapping observed on
 * GM AAOS 2024 Silverado at 2026-05-03 only:
 *   Empty timeline + STATE_IDLE                            → switcher drops Carlink (regression)
 *   Non-empty timeline + STATE_READY + playWhenReady=false → source visible, paused
 *   Non-empty timeline + STATE_BUFFERING + playWhenReady=true → source is "preparing"
 * These mappings were observed on a single firmware build; treat them as field findings,
 * not specifications. [setProjectionActive] / [setInactive] choose the [Player.State]
 * combination that produced the desired switcher behavior on the observed firmware.
 *
 * OBSERVED OS BEHAVIOR — stale homescreen Media card after force-stop
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The findings below are point-in-time observations as of 2026-05-03 from the AOSP
 * source tree readings noted, plus on-device repros on the firmware/builds named.
 * Treat them as field findings, not as a contract guarantee. AOSP and OEM firmware
 * change frequently; re-verify on upgrade or before relying on these for design
 * decisions in newer code.
 *
 * Reproduced (under the test conditions noted) on:
 *   - zeno.carlink (this Media3 projection app) — 2026-04-21.
 *   - Apple Music 5.2.1 (com.apple.android.music), a first-party vendor app using
 *     standard MediaBrowserService + MediaSession — 2026-04-21, same symptom.
 * The repro on a first-party vendor app on the same date suggests the issue is not
 * specific to this app's code; on that basis we did not pursue app-side workarounds.
 * The same failure plausibly affects the GM WidgetPanel media widget and the GM
 * Cluster media panel (they appear to consume MediaSession through the same
 * plumbing), but that has not been independently confirmed.
 *
 * Symptom (as observed): force-stopping the app and relaunching (with the data
 *   source — phone, streaming service, etc. — still producing content) left
 *   CarLauncher's homescreen Media card showing only the app name with no
 *   metadata/artwork. The new session token was ACTIVE; CarMediaService dumpsys
 *   reported `current playback media component: <package>` and `media playback
 *   state: 3` (PLAYING); the card stayed blank.
 *
 * Apparent root cause (per AOSP source read on 2026-05-03; line numbers and class
 * paths may drift in newer branches — grep symbol names rather than line numbers
 * when re-verifying):
 *   - The relevant ViewModel observed in the read was
 *     `com.android.car.media.common.playback.PlaybackViewModel` in the
 *     `car-media-common` library (CarLauncher itself appeared to consume it via
 *     `com.android.car.carlauncher.homescreen.audio.MediaViewModel`). On the read
 *     date PlaybackViewModel binds a `MediaControllerCompat` to the original
 *     session token (around PlaybackViewModel.java:156) and on `onSessionDestroyed`
 *     nulls the controller (around line 303-308) with an in-tree TODO at line 306
 *     ("consider keeping track of orphaned callbacks in case they are resurrected"),
 *     which appears to acknowledge an unhandled gap.
 *   - The controller did not appear to be replaced on the same-package
 *     inactive→active transition because three layered equality guards short-
 *     circuited the rebind path on the AOSP read: `CarMediaService.setPrimaryMediaSource`
 *     early-returned when the new ComponentName equaled the current one (around
 *     line 1311); upstream `MediaSourceViewModel.updateModelState` early-returned
 *     on `MediaSource.equals` (which appeared to compare on ComponentName only);
 *     and `PlaybackViewModel.onMediaBrowsingStateChanged` itself early-returned on
 *     equal BrowsingState. Within those observations, a freshly minted MediaSession
 *     token for the same package never caused `onMediaBrowsingStateChanged` to
 *     re-fire, and the nulled controller stayed nulled.
 *   - CarMediaService also appeared to persist "last playback primary" to a
 *     SharedPreferences file named `com.android.car.media.car_media_service`
 *     (CarMediaService.java around lines 118-121, 535 in the read). The on-disk
 *     path was not confirmed by this audit; an earlier comment here pointed at
 *     `/data/user/0/com.android.car/` which we are flagging as unverified.
 *     On boot, `initUser` (around line 450) appeared to read that preference and
 *     re-assert the selection via `notifyListeners` (around line 487), but the
 *     same equality guards above appeared to prevent any actual rebind — so the
 *     symptom observed was a CarLauncher card with no controller bound, not a
 *     card bound to a stale token. (An earlier wording in this KDoc described it
 *     as the latter; corrected here to match the AOSP source as read.)
 *
 * Workarounds tried (all failed):
 *   - Two-step source switch (select another source, switch back).
 *   - Self-MediaBrowser rebind / MAIN+APP_MUSIC self-intent.
 *   - Making the session INACTIVE-by-default until PLUGGED event (this current design).
 *   - Emulator restart.
 *   - Force-stop + relaunch with fresh session token.
 *
 * Only workaround that succeeded in our 2026-05-03 testing: full package uninstall +
 * reinstall + emulator restart. `adb install -r` (replace) did not clear the cached
 * state in the runs observed; the install needed to remove the package to (apparently)
 * cause CarMediaService's SharedPreferences to purge the stored primary-source
 * reference. This is a behavioral observation, not a documented contract — different
 * AOSP/firmware revisions may behave differently, and a future Media3 or AAOS update
 * could make a less-invasive workaround viable.
 *
 * Implication: the [setProjectionActive]/[setInactive] toggle below is architecturally
 * correct (session should not squat as playback-primary when the adapter is idle) but
 * did not appear to resolve the stale-card behavior in our 2026-05-03 testing —
 * resolution likely requires a fix in `car-media-common` PlaybackViewModel (e.g.
 * handling orphaned-controller resurrection per the in-tree TODO observed at
 * PlaybackViewModel.java:306, or loosening the ComponentName-only equality in the
 * observed `MediaSource.equals` so same-package new-token transitions notify
 * listeners). This depends on AOSP behavior that may be addressed in newer releases;
 * re-test after AOSP updates before assuming the workaround is still necessary.
 *
 * OBSERVED BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY WITH GM AAOS OBSERVERS (as of 2026-05-03)
 * Media3 [MediaSession] appears to register a platform-level
 * `android.media.session.MediaSession` for legacy observers. Decompiled
 * GMCarMediaService on the firmware tested (c0/g.java:105
 * MediaSessionCompat.Token.a(..getSessionToken()), :176
 * getSystemService("media_session"), :241 android.media.session.MediaController
 * .registerCallback) appeared to bind via MediaBrowserCompat/MediaControllerCompat
 * shims over platform APIs — we did not see direct androidx usage. On that basis the
 * Media3 migration appears transparent to the ClusterService → IClusterHmi widget
 * pipeline on the build tested. Re-verify on different GM firmware revisions.

             *   - [ROOT_ID]              → [onGetItem] returns isBrowsable=true → subscription
             *                              accepted, [notifyChildrenChanged] becomes deliverable.
             *   - [BROWSE_INFO_ITEM_ID]  → [onGetItem] returns isBrowsable=false → subscription
             *                              rejected. This is intentional under the current
             *                              design: the info-item is a terminal display row,
             *                              not a browsable parent, so a rejection there is the
             *                              behavior we want.
             *   - any other id           → [onGetItem] returns ERROR_BAD_VALUE → subscription
             *                              rejected.
             * If a future Media3 release changes the default behavior of `onSubscribe`, this
