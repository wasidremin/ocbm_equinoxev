/**
 * Main Carlink Manager — OCBM.
 *
 * Central orchestrator for the CarPlay-only app against the **open OCBM userspace** on a
 * CPC200-CCPA:
 * - USB device lifecycle ([UsbBulkTransport]) and the OCBM session ([OcbmClient])
 * - Video via [HevcRenderer], fed from `CH_VIDEO` through the forward-encrypted seam
 * - Audio via [AacPlayer] (media) and [VoiceRouter] (telephony/Siri/alert/nav)
 * - Microphone capture gated by the box's own `CT_UPLINK`, shipped over `CH_MIC`
 * - MediaSession integration for AAOS (metadata + album art) from `CH_METADATA`
 * - Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff and Pattern A / Pattern C escalation
 *
 * ## What changed from the riddleBox era, and why the shape is different
 *
 * The old manager was a **message pump**: one `handleMessage` switch over decoded protocol
 * messages, from which every piece of session state was *inferred*. OCBM inverts that — the box
 * states things directly (`CT_BT_PHASE`, `SEV_PHONE_*`, `CT_UPLINK`, per-stream `audioType`), so
 * the pump is gone and this class is a set of callbacks wired to [OcbmClient].
 *
 * Two whole categories of bug disappear with it:
 * - **Voice-mode arbitration.** riddleBox required a `VoiceMode` state machine because
 *   `PHONECALL_START` arrived ~130 ms *before* `SIRI_STOP`, and a naive reading killed the call's
 *   microphone. OCBM routes per stream by `audioType`, so there is no command ordering to reason
 *   about, and the mic is gated by the box.
 * - **Format guessing.** Audio formats came from a `decodeType` byte mapped through a fixed table;
 *   now each stream carries its own `SEAM_FORMAT`.
 *
 * ## The public API is deliberately unchanged
 *
 * Every member the UI and media layers call keeps its exact signature, so `MainActivity`,
 * `MainScreen`, `PhonesTab` and everything under `media/` compile untouched. That is why
 * [sendMultiTouch] still takes riddleBox's `MessageSerializer.TouchPoint`: it is the app's
 * host-side input value type now, and rewriting `MainScreen.handleTouchEvent` (110 lines of
 * hard-won deadband / ACTION_CANCEL / DOWN-demotion logic) while also swapping protocols would
 * have been two risky changes at once.
