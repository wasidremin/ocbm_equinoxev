/**
 * GM CCPA — the instrument shell for the wireless CarPlay receiver.
 *
 * Started life as a non-privileged capability prober named NetProbe (`com.carlink.netprobe`), renamed
 * 2026-08-14; the logcat tag stays `NETPROBE` because `native/carplay-jni/src/lib.rs` writes it from
 * Rust and `tools/tri_capture.sh` greps for it. The feasibility probes it was built around have
 * served their purpose and were retired 2026-08-12 (then docs/11 task T6.2, "Trim MainActivity feasibility probes"; the row was dropped from the ledger in the 2026-08-31 rewrite). What remains is the launcher UI, the `--es run`
 * command dispatcher, and the permanent diagnostic verbs: `mdns_self`, `ocbm_state`.
 *
 * Export goes through the Storage Access Framework (ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT) -> built-in file manager
 * -> USB, because the app's external files dir is NOT reachable by adb (`run-as` is blocked on this
 * user build, and so is `adb pull` of the app's private dir) or by other apps on this unit.

     *    `go_idle` plus `wireless_up`'s carplayd reap and its fresh `apply_host_wifi_creds`.
     *  - Touch the pairing. No `forgetPhone`, no `MGMT_FORGET_*`, and the peer store is not deleted:
     *    `go_idle` and `wireless_down` never touch the box's key store, and `carplay_peers.bin` is
     *    deleted only by Forget Pairing. A restart must never cost the driver a re-pair.
     *  - Retry on its own. Each failure is named so the driver knows whether pressing again can help.
     *
     * Ordering that is load-bearing: the supervisor is told first (the teardown is deliberate, not a
     * fault); the probe is dropped and rebuilt so its HELLO carries a NEW nonce (OcbmProbe.hostInstance
     * — a lost CT_STOP is otherwise read by the box as "presence never dropped" and no wireless_up
     * runs); and [autoStart] rebuilds the probe BEFORE the receiver, because CarPlayRx captures
     * `mfiRelay()` in its constructor.
