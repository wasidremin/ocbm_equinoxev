/**
 * The USB attach entry point: a NoDisplay trampoline that filters to the OCBM adapter and forwards
 * into [MainActivity]'s attach path.
 *
 * ## Why this is no longer a package squat (2026-09-08)
 * This class used to be `android.car.usb.handler.UsbHostManagementActivity`, and the app used to
 * install under that package name, because GM's framework-res sets
 * `config_UsbDeviceConnectionHandling_component` to that exact component and then STRIPS the
 * package — so the theory was that squatting the name would make the framework grant USB permission
 * to our UID silently, with no dialog.
 *
 * **IT DID NOT WORK (owner, 2026-09-10).** This KDoc used to say the squat "made the framework grant
 * USB permission to our UID silently on every attach, with no dialog (device-proven 2026-08-17)" and
 * that "it worked, but only about half the time". That is too generous and is the kind of note that
 * gets a bad idea re-attempted: **the app still needed the user to grant permission for the
 * adapter.** The squat did not remove the permission requirement, which was its whole purpose. The
 * old wording also contradicted itself — "every attach, device-proven" against "about half the time
 * in the field" — and the owner's account is which of the two to believe. It made the app
 * impersonate a platform component for a benefit that never materialised.
 *
 * The app is back to `wasidremin.gmccpa`, so the fixed-handler path no longer resolves to us at all and
 * the ORDINARY attach resolver is the only route in: the `<intent-filter>` +
 * `res/xml/device_filter.xml` below match `0x1314:0x2d00`, the framework shows the standard USB
 * permission dialog, and "always open for this device" makes it a one-time cost per install. That
 * degrades correctly because [UsbBulkTransport] polls `hasPermission()` as the authoritative signal
 * rather than trusting the grant broadcast — the claim loop simply waits until the grant exists.
 *
 * The diagnostics below are kept as-is. They were written to explain the squat's intermittency, and
 * every one of them is equally the right evidence for a dialog that does not appear, a grant that
 * does not land, or a box that comes back with a different descriptor.
 *
 * ## Why this logs so much (2026-08-26; premise corrected 2026-09-10)
 * Written when the squat's behaviour was thought to be intermittent rather than absent. The fields
 * are still exactly the right evidence — for a dialog that does not appear, a grant that does not
 * land, or a box that returns under a different descriptor — so they are kept verbatim; only the
 * premise below was wrong. As recorded: some days every attach seemed silent, other days
 * the permission dialog returned for days on end. It was never reproducible with a Mac attached, so
 * the fault was never captured. (Tense corrected 2026-09-10: this paragraph still read as if the
 * squat were live, two days after it was reverted. The question it poses — grant landed or not, and
 * why — is unchanged under the ordinary resolver; only the mechanism that was supposed to grant is.) This is the EARLIEST code we control on an attach — the framework
 * launches it for every device whether or not the grant landed — so it is the right place to record
 * the state that separates the competing explanations. Every field below exists to kill one
 * hypothesis; none of it is decoration:
 *
 *  - **uid / user** — the grant is per-UID *and per Android user*. The app installs `--user 10`
 *    (docs/06 §86). If an attach is ever handled for a different user, the grant simply does not
 *    apply and the dialog is correct behaviour, not a bug.
 *  - **process age** — the framework grants and *then* launches us. On a cold start we may sample
 *    `hasPermission` before the grant commits, which looks identical to "no grant" in a log but is a
 *    race. A young process with `held=false` means race; an old process with `held=false` means the
 *    grant genuinely is not there.
 *  - **device identity (serial, config/interface shape)** — the permission cache is keyed on device
 *    identity. The CCPA can enumerate as more than one descriptor variant (`/script/ncm_only` flips
 *    it between a shell-bearing NCM build and a pure OCBM accessory), and a different descriptor is
 *    a different device to the cache, so a previously-granted box can come back unrecognised.
 *  - **sourceDir / versionName** — proves WHICH apk instance the framework actually resolved, which
 *    is the check that matters if a stock `android.car.usb.handler` is ever present to compete.
 *
 * A `SecurityException` reading the serial is itself a finding: since API 29 `getSerialNumber()` is
 * gated on holding USB permission for the device, so it fails exactly when the grant did not land.
