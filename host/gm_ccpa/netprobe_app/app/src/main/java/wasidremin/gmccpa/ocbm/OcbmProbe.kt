/**
 * The OCBM probe section — grows NetProbe from "what can this app see on the network" into the
 * permanent instrument for the CCPA link. Each capability lands here first, observable and
 * isolated, before it becomes product code.
 *
 * Two entry points:
 *   [selfTest]  — framing + client bring-up against a FakeTransport. No hardware, no adapter.
 *   [runAll]    — the real link: claim, HELLO, MGMT_INFO snapshot, SETTIME, MFi, MGMT_INFO, SUBSCRIBE, heartbeat.
 *
 * ## Severity, since 2026-09-10
 *
 * The bring-up ladder in [runAllLocked] used to narrate every failure at INFO: `ABORT: …` through
 * [sink], `cert: NO RESPONSE (timeout)` through `mfiLog.i`. The 2026-09-09 drive produced 634 `I`
 * lines, 7 `W` and 0 `E` across a 15 s MFi sign timeout and an `ocbmd` restart. Now: a step that does
 * not happen is a [SessionTrace] expectation armed with the budget the step already waits
 * ([OcbmClient.hello] 20 s, [OcbmClient.setTime] 2 s, [OcbmClient.MFI_CERT_TIMEOUT_MS] 12 s,
 * [OcbmClient.MFI_SIGN_TIMEOUT_MS] 15 s), an aborted bring-up goes through [abort] at ERROR and marks
 * the link FAILED on the Board, and a chip status that is not OK is an ERROR. `W` is reserved for
 * degraded-but-continuing (no MGMT_INFO, a re-raised permission dialog); `I` narrates success.

     * permission dialog frequently never appears and the result broadcast is often lost, so a single

     * flood a 16 MiB ring buffer. Two additions (2026-09-10) keep the wait from LOOKING dead
     * without breaking that rule — the reference failure is an adapter that is present but never
     * granted, which produced exactly two lines in ten minutes:
     *  - the first dialog request arms [OcbmExpect.USB_PERMISSION] with [REQUEST_INTERVAL_MS], so a
     *    grant that does not arrive before the dialog would be re-raised is an `EXPECTED-MISSING`
     *    at ERROR (once — it is not re-armed on later requests);
     *  - each re-raise after that is one WARN line with the elapsed time, i.e. one line per 30 s
     *    for as long as the state persists, never per poll;
     *  - the waiting states are written under [OcbmBoard.USB_CLAIM] so a status block says
     *    "adapter present, USB permission not held" rather than nothing.

     * dead because a line discipline was never loaded, and the only place that was visible was a box
     * log the app could already have fetched over a cable it was already holding.
     *
     * `captureBoxLogsNow` (which this offsets map backs) is a one-shot snapshot pull, emitted through
     * ProbeLog so it lands in logcat with no extra wiring. Live, continuous box narration no longer
