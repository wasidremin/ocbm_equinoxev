/**
 * Ask the link what our OWN advert actually looks like.
 *
 * `rx-connect` — the proven implementation — pins the advertised address explicitly
 * (`RX_ADDR=192.168.43.1`) precisely because its `enable_addr_auto()` alternative publishes EVERY
 * interface address. `NsdManager` offers no equivalent control: it publishes the platform hostname
 * with whatever address set the system mdnsd chooses, over whatever interfaces it chooses. On a head
 * unit carrying `br0`, a Wi-Fi client interface and a cellular VLAN, iOS can therefore resolve our
 * SRV to an address it has no route to — it would still accept our connect-out (we dialed it) but
 * could never open the control connection back.
 *
 * That is a hypothesis, and this turns it into a measurement: query the link for our own SRV and
 * A/AAAA records and print exactly what a phone would receive.
