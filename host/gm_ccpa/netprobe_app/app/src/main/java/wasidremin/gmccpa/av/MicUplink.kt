/**
 * Microphone uplink: vehicle mic → the Rust receiver → the iPhone.
 *
 * The receiver opens `127.0.0.1:9112` at library load. We connect to it and the socket carries BOTH
 * directions:
 *  - IN  (receiver → us): `uplink on <rate> <ch>\n` when iOS SETUPs type 100 with `input=true`, and
 *    `uplink off\n` at teardown. **This is the capture gate.**
 *  - OUT (us → receiver): `mic <len>\n` followed by `<len>` bytes of S16LE PCM.
 *
 * The Rust side does RTP framing, encryption with the stream INPUT key, and the byte-order swap.
 *
 * **Gate on the control line, never on downlink activity.** Siri wants the mic BEFORE any downlink
 * audio arrives, so an activity-based gate clips the onset of every request.
 *
 * **Connect eagerly, not on first data.** The same socket carries the gate, so a data-triggered
 * connect deadlocks: no connection → no gate → no capture → no data.
 *
 * ## This class IS live — both uplink encoders are compiled
 *
 * `carplay-jni/Cargo.toml` enables receiver `mic-uplink` (wired big-endian PCM) and defaults
 * `mic-uplink-eld` ON, so the truck x86_64 `.so` built by `tools/build_apk.sh` carries libfdk-aac
 * and the AAC-ELD entries in `/info` are real; the mic uplink is owner-confirmed on the truck
 * (`docs/13_AUDIO_ROUTING.md` §4). The ELD bail exists only for an aarch64/Pi build made with
 * `--no-default-features`. Do not assume this class is dormant.
