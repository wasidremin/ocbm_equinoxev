/**
 * AAC-LC decoder + [AudioTrack] playback for the CarPlay media stream.
 *
 * The seam delivers ADTS (`forward.rs` wraps the AUs), device-confirmed as AAC-LC 48 kHz stereo, which
 * matches what the SETUP dict negotiates (`audioFormat=0x800000`). ADTS carries its own header, so the
 * decoder is configured from the first frame's header rather than from `/info` — if iOS ever picks a
 * different rate the stream stays self-describing.
 *
 * Playback uses `USAGE_MEDIA`, so it routes through the head unit's normal media path and obeys the
 * volume knob. The `AudioTrack` is built from the ADTS header's rate and channel count — speculatively
 * in [prime], then adopted or rebuilt in [configure] — not from the decoder's reported output format;
 * for AAC-LC (no SBR/PS) the two are identical, which is what CarPlay negotiates.
 *
 * ## Media must HOLD audio focus, or the volume knob gets stuck
 *
 * [am] is not optional in practice. AAOS points the hardware volume control at the current audio-focus
 * owner, and it returns focus to the **previous owner** when a transient holder abandons it. VoiceRouter
 * takes `AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT` for Siri and calls; if media never held focus there is nothing to
 * hand back to, so after a call or a Siri turn the knob stays pointed at Phone/Siri while media plays —
 * the head unit's volume UI then adjusts a group the driver cannot hear. Holding `AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN` here
 * gives the system a resting owner to return to. It also lets AAOS duck us properly for navigation
 * rather than relying solely on our own software ducking in [setVoiceDucked]/[setFocusGain].

     * `codec == null` and rebuild a codec + playing track that nothing would ever free.
     *

     * analogue of the caller closing the socket: a socket close unblocks a consume thread parked in
     * `read()`, but never one parked in the blocking `write()`. `pause()` interrupts the ONE write that
     * may be in flight (native `AudioTrack::pause` -> `proxy->interrupt()`, the write returns short);
     * `flush()` then drops queued PCM so nothing plays out after stop. CORRECTED 2026-09-10: this used
     * to model the consume thread as parked in `write()` for as long as the track stayed paused. It
     * never is — once paused, every later `write` returns short at once instead of parking (see
     * [framesDiscardedPaused]), and the loop leaves on its next `running` check in [processAdts].
     * The pause is still required for the in-flight write; it is just not a standing property.
     *
     * Silence the track BEFORE abandoning focus — the same order as `VoiceRouter.Sink.release()`
     * (pause → flush → stop → release, then abandon). AAOS hands focus to the next owner the moment we
     * abandon; until 2026-09-09 that came first, so for the window before `pause()` landed we were
     * still writing PCM at full gain while another app had already been told it owned focus.
     *
     * `running=false` is written under `this` so that [requestFocus]'s GRANTED block, which reads it
     * under the same monitor, cannot cache a grant after this has decided there is nothing to
     * abandon (see the "grant vs. teardown" window on [requestFocus]). [abandonFocus] itself stays

     * (audible gaps), `I` only when clean. [framesDiscardedPaused] is NOT a fault and never lifts the

     *  nothing here reads the duck or hold flags, because doing so before the publish is exactly the
     *  window that lost edges (see [publishTrack]).
     *
     *  # Buffer depth: [TRACK_BUFFER_MS] of audio, floored at 2 × `getMinBufferSize` (2026-09-10)
     *
     *  Was `maxOf(minBuf, 8192) * 2` — 85–160 ms at 48 kHz stereo, rate-blind, and smaller than a
     *  single delivery gap from the phone; the 2026-09-09 truck capture paid 6 underruns for it, 5 of
     *  them in the first 9 s. The reasoning for the number is on the constant. What it COSTS, stated
     *  so nobody "optimises" it back down without re-measuring:
     *
     *  - **First sound waits for a full buffer.** AudioFlinger's `Track::isReady()` refuses to mix a
     *    freshly (re)added `MODE_STREAM` track until `framesReady() >= bufferSizeInFrames` — and
     *    `addTrack_l` resets that FILLING state on EVERY add, including a `play()` after `pause()`
     *    removed the track from the active list. With the phone pacing at realtime, that is
     *    ~[TRACK_BUFFER_MS] of wall clock from the first frame of a stream to the first audible one
     *    (was ~85–160 ms). After a Siri hold the buffer is normally still full from before the
     *    pause, so resume is immediate.
     *  - **A track skip replays what is buffered.** Up to [TRACK_BUFFER_MS] of the old song plays
     *    after the phone has moved on. Nothing upstream flushes on our behalf.
     *  - **One benign `AudioFlinger: BUFFER TIMEOUT: remove(N)` per stream start, followed by
     *    `AudioTrack: restartIfDisabled(...) disabled due to previous underrun, restarting`.** The
     *    mixer gives a filling track ~450 ms on this unit (prime at 22:51:14.443, timeout at
     *    22:51:14.899 in the capture) before parking it; the next `write` restarts it with its
     *    contents intact and the fill continues. That pair is now EXPECTED at every stream start and
     *    is not the underrun it is named after — `underrunCount` at the first played frame is logged
     *    so the two are not confused.
     *
     *  The log line here prints what was asked, what `getMinBufferSize` said, and what
     *  `bufferSizeInFrames` reports was actually granted — the server may round, and a capture must
     *  show the real depth rather than the requested one. */
