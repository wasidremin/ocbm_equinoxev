/**
 * How much disk one capture scope is allowed to consume.
 *
 * Two numbers matter and they are NOT the same number. [maxFileBytes] bounds one *file* — it exists
 * so an export over SAF/USB moves in digestible chunks and so a truncated tail costs one chunk, not
 * the session. [totalCeilingBytes] bounds the *directory* — it is the only thing standing between a
 * multi-day unattended capture and a full `/data` on the head unit. The reference logger
 * (`carlink_native/.../FileLogManager.kt`) has only the first and gets away with it because it
 * captures one tag; whole-OS logcat on this unit measures ~63 KB/s (923 421 lines / 147 MB over a
 * 39-minute leg in `evidence/drive_20260818-132220`), i.e. ~227 MB/h unfiltered. Without a directory
 * ceiling that fills any partition in a day.
 *
 * [freeFloorBytes] is the second half of the storage guarantee: a static ceiling is not safe on a
 * partition that some *other* subsystem has already nearly filled, so [LogFiles.sweep] additionally
 * refuses to occupy space that would take free space below this floor, and hard-stops the capture
 * if even the minimum working set will not fit. Better to lose the capture than to brick the unit's
 * `/data`.
 *
 * [retentionMs] is hygiene, not safety. It is enforced from mtime, which a head unit's post-boot
 * clock correction can move backwards; when that happens files look younger or older than they are
 * and retention over- or under-deletes. The byte ceiling is unaffected by any clock and is therefore
 * the property to rely on.

/**
 * The rotating, byte-budgeted file sink. Everything about *where bytes land* lives here; nothing
 * about logcat, subprocesses or threads does.
 *
 * **Threading.** Every public method takes [lock] and does its work under it. The lock protects the
 * whole of the mutable set — [out], [current], [currentBytes], [seq], [closed], [degradedSinceMs] —
 * and nothing outside this class touches those. Callers may be any thread; in practice there are
 * three (the 1 Hz flush executor, an arbitrary caller of `LogCapture.flush()`, and the shutdown
 * thread) and the lock is held only across the actual `write(2)`/`unlink(2)`, never across anything
 * that blocks on another thread. This class never calls back into [LogCapture], so it cannot
 * participate in a lock cycle.
 *
 * **Rotation is pre-write, not post-write.** The reference logger checks size *after* writing and
 * therefore overshoots by up to a full batch; here the batch is encoded first and rotation happens
 * if it would not fit. Files exceed [Budget.maxFileBytes] only when a single batch alone exceeds it,
 * which the producer-side backpressure cap already makes bounded. Costs nothing, so there was no
 * reason to inherit the overshoot.
 *
 * **Durability.** Batches are written with no fsync, then fsync'd at most every [SYNC_INTERVAL_MS].
 * A process kill loses nothing (the page cache survives it); an abrupt vehicle power cut loses at
 * most the last ~10 s. Per-batch fsync at 1 Hz would close that window but writes 86 400 barriers a
 * day to eMMC for a marginal gain — the fault being chased is minutes long, not seconds.
 *
 * **Write failures do not end the session.** ENOSPC or a revoked fd closes the writer and enters a
 * degraded state that retries the open every [REOPEN_BACKOFF_MS]. The reference degrades to a
 * permanent silent drop-all recoverable only by a disable/enable cycle; over a multi-day unattended
 * run that turns one transient full disk into a lost capture.
