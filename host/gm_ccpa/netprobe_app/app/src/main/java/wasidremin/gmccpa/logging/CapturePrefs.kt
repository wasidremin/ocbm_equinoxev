/**
 * The one persisted knob the capture engine needs: which scope to run at.
 *
 * Kept out of [LogCapture] on purpose — the engine takes a [LogCapture.Config] and has no opinion on
 * where it came from, which is what let it be unit-checked in isolation. This is the boot receiver's
 * and the UI's shared view of the operator's choice, and nothing else.
 *
 * Default is [LogCapture.Scope.WHOLE_OS] rather than the safer-sounding own-process. That is
 * deliberate: whole-OS DEGRADES on its own when `READ_LOGS` is not granted (the engine probes, falls
 * back, and says so in the file header), so defaulting to it costs nothing on an ungranted unit and
 * means a freshly-granted unit starts capturing the system side without anyone remembering to come
 * back and flip a switch. The failure mode of the opposite default — a granted unit quietly
 * capturing only our own process for a week of drives — is the expensive one.
