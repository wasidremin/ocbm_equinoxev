/**
 * A bounded, blocking byte pipe that presents itself as an [InputStream].
 *
 * This is the join between the OCBM seam layer and the three proven renderers (`HevcRenderer`,
 * `VoiceRouter`, `AacPlayer`). Those all have the same shape — `consume(ins: InputStream)`, blocking,
 * owning their codec for the life of the call on their own thread — because they were written against
 * the box's *legacy on-box-decrypt* TCP seams. Handing them one of these instead of a socket means the
 * decrypt path can feed them **without touching a line of renderer code**: they cannot tell the
 * difference, which also makes an A/B against the box's own legacy seam a one-line change.
 *
 * ## Why bounded, and why blocking
 *
 * The cap is the project's closed-loop backpressure, not a buffer-size tuning knob. When a lane backs
 * up, [write] blocks the OCBM read thread; the USB pipe fills; the box's per-stream read-gate stops
 * pulling; the iPhone throttles *that* encoder. That is the designed behaviour
 * (`ccpa_custom/docs/16`, and the 24 MB lane cap in the macOS host's `OCBMAVDecrypt.swift:160-183`) —
 * the alternative, an unbounded queue, converts a transient decode stall into unbounded host memory
 * growth and a latency spike that never recovers.
 *
 * Queueing whole messages rather than bytes keeps a producer write O(1) and never splits a message
 * across two [write] calls, so a slow consumer can never observe a torn header.
 *
 * ## Lifetime
 *
 * [close] makes pending and subsequent reads return EOF, which is what every renderer treats as "seam
 * ended" — they release their codec and return from `consume` on their own thread, which is the only
 * thread allowed to release it. Closing is therefore the correct and complete way to stop a lane.
