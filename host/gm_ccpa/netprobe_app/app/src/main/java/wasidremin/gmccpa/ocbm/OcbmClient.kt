/**
 * The OCBM host client — the Kotlin equivalent of `ocbm-host`'s `Link` and the macOS
 * `OCBMClient.swift`, driving any [RawBulkTransport].
 *
 * Bring-up order, which is load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. CT_HELLO, retransmitted until CT_HELLO_ACK arrives. Every other frame is DISCARDED while
 *      waiting — a prior session can leave kernel-buffered A/V frames queued ahead of the ACK.
 *   2. CT_SETTIME immediately. The box has no RTC battery, so its clock is bogus at every boot and
 *      CarPlay's TLS pairing needs a real one.
 *   3. CT_SUBSCRIBE with the config blob. This is the presence latch: `/tmp/host_present` goes to 1
 *      and the box supervisor brings the radios up from that edge. THE APP IS THE IGNITION.
 *   4. CT_HEARTBEAT at 1 Hz. Miss the box's 10 s watchdog and it emits SEV_HOST_GONE, clears its
 *      own `subscribed` flag, and no heartbeat restores presence until a fresh SUBSCRIBE (it answers
 *      an unsubscribed host's heartbeat only with a HOST_GONE nudge every 30 s).
 *
 * ## What the box is expected to say back, and by when (2026-09-10)
 *
 * Every step above that waits for the box arms a [SessionTrace] expectation with the SAME budget the
 * waiting code already uses, so a step that never answers is an `!! EXPECTED-MISSING` line at ERROR
 * instead of a `return false` the caller may or may not narrate:
 *
 *  - [OcbmExpect.HELLO_ACK] in [hello] — the caller's `timeoutMs` (20 s default, 4 s on the
 *    post-sign-timeout re-HELLO).
 *  - [OcbmExpect.SETTIME_ACK] in [setTime] — its `timeoutMs` (2 s; 1 s inside [subscribe]).
 *  - [OcbmExpect.HOST_PRESENT] in [subscribe] — [BOX_REPLY_BUDGET_MS]: `ocbmd` raises presence and
 *    answers `SEV_HOST_PRESENT` synchronously (2 ms device-observed 2026-09-09).
 *  - [OcbmExpect.HCI_PRESENT] in [subscribe] — [BT_ATTACH_BUDGET_MS]: SUBSCRIBE is the radio-wake
 *    edge, and the first `CT_BOX_HEALTH` carrying `BH_HCI_PRESENT` is the proof that the box's BT
 *    controller actually attached. Its absence is "Bluetooth does nothing" (docs/wireless/01).
 *  - [OcbmExpect.LOG_FIRST_LINE] in [logCtl] — [BOX_REPLY_BUDGET_MS]: arming CH_LOG replays every
 *    source from offset 0, so the first `[box:*]` line follows within milliseconds. This is the
 *    absence [reArmAfterMgmt] was written for: "no box lines" is otherwise indistinguishable from
 *    "the box has nothing to say".
 *
 * The same transitions keep the [SessionTrace.Board] current under the [OcbmBoard] names, so a
 * `## STATUS` block at any offset shows the link, the heartbeat, the log stream, the radio inhibit,
 * the last decoded box health, the BT phase, the identified phone and the pairing code. Updates
 * are on TRANSITIONS only — never per frame in [handleLog], never per tick in the heartbeat.
 *
 * @param trace false disables every [SessionTrace] call. `OcbmProbe.selfTest` drives this class
 *   against a scripted `FakeTransport` that deliberately answers `SEV_HOST_GONE`; with tracing on,
 *   that would print a FAILED link and, ten seconds after the test ended, a missing HOST_PRESENT
 *   for a box that never existed. A silent logger already says the test wants no side effects.
