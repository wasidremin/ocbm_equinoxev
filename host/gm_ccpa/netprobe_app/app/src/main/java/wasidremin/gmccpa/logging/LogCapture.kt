/**
 * Always-on, untethered log capture: drains this device's logcat into rotating, byte-budgeted files
 * under `filesDir/logs/` so a fault that happens with no Mac attached is still recoverable.
 *
 * ## Why logcat and not a [ProbeLog] listener
 * The reference implementation this is ported from (`carlink_native/.../logging/FileLogManager.kt`)
 * hooks its logger's listener interface. That is wrong here, because only *half* of this app's
 * output goes through [ProbeLog]. The Rust receiver core emits ~138 `println!`/`eprintln!` calls
 * which `native/carplay-jni/src/lib.rs` dup2()s onto fd 1/2 and pushes straight to
 * `__android_log_write` under the same `NETPROBE` tag with a `[rust ]` prefix — they never touch
 * Kotlin. Draining logcat is the only capture point that sees both sides in one ordered stream, and
 * it is also the only one that is a *time machine*: `logcat -d` returns what is ALREADY in the ring
 * buffer, so a capture started after a fault still recovers the fault.
 *
 * ## Scopes
 * - [Scope.OWN_PROCESS] — always available. An app may always read its own entries; `--pid=<us>`
 *   makes that explicit. Sees `NETPROBE` (Kotlin) and `[rust ]` (JNI core) and nothing else.
 * - [Scope.WHOLE_OS] — needs `android.permission.READ_LOGS`, whose protection level is
 *   `signature|privileged|development`. The `development` bit is why it is reachable at all:
 *   `adb shell pm grant <our-package> android.permission.READ_LOGS` — see [grantCmd], which fills
 *   in the package from the running app rather than a literal (it was a literal, and it went stale
 *   at the 2026-09-08 package revert; fixed 2026-09-09). Two operational
 *   traps, both of which this class detects and logs rather than failing silently:
 *   1. `pm grant` REJECTS a permission the manifest does not request. `AndroidManifest.xml` must
 *      carry `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_LOGS"/>` or the grant errors
 *      out. (Declaring it is harmless when ungranted — it stays denied.) Not done in this class;
 *      see the wiring task.
 *   2. READ_LOGS is mapped to the supplementary gid `log`, and supplementary gids are assigned at
 *      **fork time**. After a grant, the already-running process still lacks the gid:
 *      `checkSelfPermission` says GRANTED while logd still filters output to our own uid. So the
 *      permission check alone is not proof, and [Session.verifyScope] additionally checks whether
 *      any captured line carries a pid other than ours. When it does not, that is an ERROR (since
 *      2026-09-10; it was a WARN): the whole-OS half of the capture — GM's CarPlay service,
 *      `wpa_supplicant`, the USB stack, the permission dialog — is silently absent for the rest of
 *      the process's life, which is precisely the evidence that scope exists to collect.
 *
 * ## Self-healing the degraded state (2026-09-10)
 *
 * The condition is permanent for the process (no unprivileged call can add a gid) and, until now,
 * nothing carried the knowledge forward: the next process start went through the same 15 s
 * verification with no memory of the last one. [ScopeMarker] persists what was learned — the
 * grant exists, this pid at this start time could not use it, how many fresh processes have failed
 * the same check — so the next start ([Session.resolveScope]) can:
 *
 *  - in a FRESH process with the grant still held and WHOLE_OS requested: say that it is re-verifying
 *    whole-OS because the previous process was stale, and clear the marker the moment a foreign
 *    pid is seen (the heal);
 *  - in the SAME process (a capture restart from the UI): skip the 15 s pretence and go straight
 *    to own-process, saying that only a re-fork can fix it;
 *  - with the grant held but OWN_PROCESS chosen by the operator: say that whole-OS is available.
 *    The operator's choice is respected — [CapturePrefs] is theirs — this is a hint, not an override;
 *  - if a FRESH process fails the check again: say so at ERROR with a DIFFERENT message, because the
 *    fork-time explanation has then been refuted for this unit and the operator must look at the
 *    grant itself (made for the right user? — the app runs as user 10, and `pm grant` without
 *    `--user` targets user 0) or at the platform's READ_LOGS -> gid mapping, not at force-stop.
 *
 * That last case is not hypothetical. In the 2026-09-09 reference session the degraded process
 * (pid 3461) had been forked at boot, 9 s BEFORE its capture started and with the grant already
 * persisted from an earlier day — so "the grant does not reach a process that was already running"
 * cannot be the whole story on that unit. The marker is what will settle it on the next start.
 *
 * Whole-OS degrades to own-process automatically when the permission is not held, with the exact
 * `pm grant` line in the log. It never silently captures nothing.
 *
 * ## Volume, and why WHOLE_OS is filtered by default
 * Measured on this unit: `evidence/drive_20260818-132220/headunit.log` is 923 421 lines / 147 MB
 * over a 39-minute leg — ~227 MB/h unfiltered, of which 88 % is V/D and 60 % is two Codec2 tags. A
 * multi-day unattended capture at that rate is not storable, so [DEFAULT_SYSTEM_FILTER] keeps V for
 * the tags that matter to the two faults being chased (USB attach permission prompt, iPhone BT
 * auto-reconnect) plus `NETPROBE`, and puts a `*:I` floor under everything else. That is ~27 MB/h,
 * which the 768 MB ceiling turns into roughly a day of rolling history. Pass `filterSpec =
 * listOf("*:V")` to capture everything and accept a ~3 h window instead.
 *
 * ## Threading model
 * Four threads touch a running session; each owns a distinct stage of a one-way pipeline and no
 * stage ever blocks the one behind it.
 *
 * 1. **Caller threads** — [start]/[stop]/[flush]/[status], any thread. [start] and [stop] serialize
 *    on [stateLock] and are idempotent; [flush] and [status] read the session through a volatile
 *    and take no engine lock at all, so they cannot be blocked by a stop in progress.
 * 2. **Pump thread** (one per session, daemon) — probes buffers, spawns `logcat`, and does the only
 *    blocking read. It *never* touches the disk: it hands lines to an in-memory queue and returns
 *    to the read immediately. This is deliberate. If the pump stalled on I/O, the child's stdout
 *    pipe would fill (64 KB), logcat would block, and logd would drop us as a slow reader — the
 *    capture would lose exactly the burst it exists to record.
 * 3. **stderr drain thread** (one per spawned child, daemon, exits at EOF) — exists solely so a
 *    child that writes diagnostics to stderr cannot wedge on a full stderr pipe. Its first 2 KB is
 *    logged when the child dies.
 * 4. **Flush executor** (single-threaded scheduler) — the only routine writer. Drains the queue at
 *    1 Hz and sweeps retention/ceiling at 1/60 Hz.
 *
 * **Locks and their order.** `stateLock` (start/stop mutual exclusion) > `flushLock` (one drainer
 * at a time, so two concurrent drains cannot interleave batches on disk) > `LogFiles.lock` (all
 * file state). `procLock` (the live [Process] handle plus the running flag) is a leaf taken only by
 * the pump and by [Session.stop], and is never held together with `flushLock` or `LogFiles.lock`.
 * The order is total and no thread acquires them in any other sequence, so the set is
 * deadlock-free. Held-across-blocking is bounded everywhere: `stateLock` is held across a bounded
 * `join`/`awaitTermination` in [stop], which is the one place a caller can wait on another thread.
 *
 * **Accepted couplings and races**, in full:
 * - [LogFiles] calls [ProbeLog] while holding its own lock. `ProbeLog.write` is now a bare
 *   `Log.println` with no fan-out, so nothing user-supplied executes under the writer lock. (This
 *   used to describe a `ProbeLog.mirror` hook said to append to a UI text buffer; the hook was never
 *   assigned and the buffer never existed. It has been removed rather than left to imply otherwise.)
 * - Drop counters are `getAndSet(0)` by the flush executor while the pump increments them. A count
 *   or two can land in the next marker instead of the current one. The total is never lost.
 * - [stop] proceeds after a bounded `join`. A pump thread that has not exited may enqueue a few
 *   more lines; the writer is closed by then, so they are discarded. They are from a killed child.
 * - Seam de-duplication is timestamp-ordered and logcat is not perfectly ordered across buffers.
 *   See [SeamFilter] for the exact window in which that can drop a line, and why it is bounded.
 *
 * ## Backpressure
 * The queue is capped in **characters**, not entries, because characters are what bound the heap
 * (~2 bytes each in UTF-16 plus per-String overhead). Above the cap the pump drops the *newest*
 * line, O(1), and counts it; when the queue drains, a `##### ... DROPPED n lines` marker is written
 * into the file. A silent gap in a fault capture is the one failure worse than a gap.

/**
 * Suppresses the overlap between one logcat child and the next.
 *
 * **The overlap is not small.** `logcat -d` dumps the ring and exits; a plain `logcat` dumps the
 * ENTIRE ring again and only then starts following. So every spawn after the first re-delivers
 * everything already written — potentially the whole buffer. That property is also a gift: it means
 * a crashed tail is restarted by re-reading the ring, and the gap during the outage is *recovered*
 * rather than lost, as long as the ring did not wrap. This filter is what makes that safe, and it
 * is why the tail is deliberately spawned WITHOUT `-T <timestamp>`: `-T` would shrink the re-dump,
 * but its argument is parsed in local time while the stream is emitted in UTC, and getting that
 * wrong silently skips or duplicates hours. A filter that needs no clock agreement is worth more
 * than the CPU saved.
 *
 * **Rule.** While armed, a line is dropped if its timestamp is older than the newest one already
 * emitted, or equal to it and byte-identical to a line already emitted at that timestamp. The first
 * line strictly newer than that disarms the filter permanently for that child; steady-state costs
 * one timestamp parse per line and nothing else.
 *
 * **Bounds and the races accepted.**
 * - logcat merges several buffers and is not perfectly timestamp-ordered across them. A line that
 *   arrives slightly out of order *inside the armed window* is dropped. Outside it — i.e. all of
 *   steady state — nothing is ever dropped. Confining the risk to the seam is the entire reason the
 *   filter disarms on first crossing rather than staying on.
 * - A backwards clock correction (a head unit sets its clock after boot) would leave the filter
 *   armed against a timestamp from the future and drop everything for ever. Hence the hard budget:
 *   after [MAX_LINES] or [MAX_MS] the filter gives up, emits a marker, and disarms. Worst case is
 *   ~30 s of duplicate-or-suppressed lines around a clock jump, which is visible in the file.
 * - [DUP_MAX] identical-timestamp lines are remembered. If more than that many entries share one
 *   millisecond, the excess may be written twice. Duplication is the benign direction.
 *
 * Called only from the pump thread; needs no synchronisation, and has none.
