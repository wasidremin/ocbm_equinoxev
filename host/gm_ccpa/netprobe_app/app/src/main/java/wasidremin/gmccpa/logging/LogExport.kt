/**
 * Gets [LogCapture]'s rotated files off the head unit and onto a USB stick, because `run-as` is
 * blocked here (see the `MainActivity` class KDoc) and this app cannot be pulled with `adb pull` either — export
 * is the ONLY retrieval path for an untethered drive capture.
 *
 * ## The ladder
 * Four rungs, tried in order, first viable one wins. "Viable" is judged at launch time (can this
 * rung even be attempted), not at outcome time — see [Options.cascadeOnSafCancel] for the one place
 * that distinction is a real decision. A rung that starts writing and then fails partway (disk full,
 * SecurityException mid-stream) cascades to the next rung rather than surfacing a failure the
 * operator cannot act on in a vehicle with no laptop.
 *
 * 1. [Rung.SAF] — `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`. Probed with `PackageManager.resolveActivity` first, so
 *    an AAOS build shipped without DocumentsUI (common — driver-distraction policy strips the
 *    picker on some units) degrades cleanly instead of throwing `ActivityNotFoundException`. Needs
 *    an [Activity] because there is no Compose `rememberLauncherForActivityResult` in this Views
 *    app; the caller's `onActivityResult` must forward into [onActivityResult].
 *
 *    **Manifest dependency this file does NOT own**: `targetSdk 32` means package-visibility
 *    filtering applies to `resolveActivity` too. Without a `<queries>` block for
 *    `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT` in `AndroidManifest.xml`, the probe can report "not available" even
 *    when DocumentsUI is present, which just means this rung is skipped one step earlier than it
 *    has to be — never a crash. Add if rung 1 should be preferred over rung 2 on units that do ship
 *    the picker:
 *    `<queries><intent><action android:name="android.intent.action.CREATE_DOCUMENT"/><data android:mimeType="text/plain"/></intent></queries>`
 *
 * 2. [Rung.USB_VOLUME] — `Context.getExternalFilesDirs(null)`. The workhorse: no picker, no runtime
 *    permission, and the multi-element form's entries past index 0 are OEM-mounted removable
 *    volumes. Index 0 is *not* skipped by position — it is skipped because `StorageManager
 *    .getStorageVolume(dir)?.isRemovable` is false for it on every real device, and position is not
 *    a contract Android makes. A volume only qualifies if it is both `isRemovable` AND currently
 *    `MEDIA_MOUNTED`; an unmounted or ejected slot's directory entry is skipped, not treated as a
 *    write target. The path landed on is still an app-sandboxed `Android/data/.../files` directory
 *    on the stick — that sandbox is a Scoped-Storage rule enforced by *this device*, not by the
 *    computer the stick is later read on, where it is an ordinary folder on an ordinary FAT/exFAT
 *    filesystem.
 *
 * 3. [Rung.MEDIA_STORE] — `MediaStore.Downloads`, requires API 29+ (this ladder runs on API 32
 *    head units per the manifest, but `minSdk 26` means a bench build could hit this method on an
 *    older device; the rung reports itself unavailable there rather than crashing on a collection
 *    that does not exist).
 *
 * 4. [Rung.FILES_DIR] — a no-op. Reports [LogCapture.logsDir] as the destination and the sum of the
 *    existing file sizes as `bytesWritten`, but **copies nothing and redacts nothing** — the files
 *    it is pointing at are exactly what [LogCapture] wrote, unredacted, sitting in `filesDir` for a
 *    later tethered pull by whatever finally gets `run-as` or root working. Do not mistake a
 *    [Rung.FILES_DIR] result for an exported artifact; it is a shrug with a path attached.
 *
 * ## One artifact, not a picker-per-file
 * Rungs 1-3 concatenate every file from [LogCapture.logFiles] (oldest first, matching capture
 * order) into a single stream, each source file's start marked with a plain-text separator line so
 * provenance survives concatenation. Plain text rather than a zip: these files are read by grepping
 * them in a parking lot with whatever is at hand, and log text does not compress enough over
 * already-line-oriented content to be worth losing that.
 *
 * ## Redaction — mandatory by default, and its exact boundaries
 * See [Redactor] for the categories, the regexes, and — just as important — what is deliberately
 * NOT caught. [Options.redact] `= false` is the explicit opt-out for an operator who has decided
 * they want the raw stream; the default is redact-on, because a USB stick is a durable artifact
 * that leaves the vehicle the moment it is pulled.
 *
 * ## API shape
 * Callback-based, not suspend: this module ships with zero dependencies (`build.gradle` — "so the
 * APK stays tiny... no transitive AndroidX/version friction"), and kotlinx-coroutines is not one of
 * them. [export] never blocks the calling thread; all I/O runs on a private single-thread executor
 * and the result is delivered on the main looper so a menu-item caller can update its own UI
 * directly. It needs no Activity subclass and makes no lifecycle assumption beyond "the Activity
 * that receives the SAF picker's `onActivityResult` is still around to forward it" — exactly the
 * same assumption `startActivityForResult` itself makes.

/**
 * Line-at-a-time redaction. One instance per export, so its per-category value->placeholder maps
 * (and therefore stable correlation across a whole session's worth of files) live exactly as long
 * as the export does and never leak into a later export's salt.
 *
 * **What this catches**, in application order (order matters where character classes could
 * overlap; a placeholder already substituted never re-matches a later rule — see the length/shape
 * guards on each regex):
 * 1. **WPA_PSK** — `psk=`, `passphrase=`, `wpa[-_]psk=`, `pre-shared-key=` (case-insensitive),
 *    quoted or bare, key-value form as `wpa_supplicant.conf` and this app's own hotspot dialog
 *    (`Ui.kt:363`) write it. Only the value is replaced; the key stays so the line is still legible
 *    as "a passphrase was here."
 * 2. **MAC_ADDRESS** — six colon- or dash-separated hex octet pairs. Deliberately not
 *    BT-MAC-specific: `CT_PHONE_IDENT.deviceID` (`ocbm/OcbmProto.kt:84`) is syntactically identical
 *    to a Wi-Fi BSSID or any other MAC-shaped string, and there is no way to tell them apart from
 *    text alone — so this rule catches both on purpose. Over-redacting a non-BT MAC is the safe
 *    direction.
 * 3. **LAT_LONG** — `lat[itude]=`/`lon[gitude]=` key-value decimal forms, and a bare
 *    `-?DD.DDDD, -?DDD.DDDD` comma-separated pair (a common raw GPS log shape). Redacts the numeric
 *    value(s) only.
 * 4. **IPV4** — every dotted-quad with valid octets, EXCEPT the four ranges below, which are
 *    fixed/well-known rather than vehicle-identifying and are left readable because a redacted
 *    `127.0.0.1` helps nobody debugging this project's own seams:
 *    - `127.0.0.0/8` — loopback; the receiver's A/V seams (:9001-9004) live here.
 *    - `169.254.0.0/16` — IPv4 link-local (RFC 3927), identical on every device.
 *    - `192.168.43.0/24` — Android's own tethering default AP subnet (`MdnsInspect.kt:15`).
 *    - `192.168.5.0/24` — this project's fixed CarPlay/AirPlay accessory subnet
 *      (`CarPlayRx.kt:138`, `:457`), not the vehicle's actual telematics or hotspot LAN.
 *    Every other IPv4 — including a `192.168.50.x`/`192.168.49.x`-style vehicle hotspot LAN or any
 *    public address — is redacted, because those DO identify this specific unit's network.
 * 5. **VIN** — 17-char alnum runs excluding `I`, `O`, `Q` (the ISO 3779 exclusion set), so a
 *    plausible-looking non-VIN string of the same shape is also caught; that is accepted
 *    over-redaction, not a bug.
 * 6. **LONG_DIGITS** — bare runs of 13+ digits: IMEI (15), MEID, ICCID, and similar identifiers.
 *    Deliberately wide; it will also catch large non-identifying counters or timestamps expressed
 *    as a single long integer. Over-redaction, accepted for the same reason as VIN.
 *
 * **What this does NOT catch — state these plainly, a false sense of safety is worse than a known
 * gap:**
 * - **NMEA GPS sentences** (`$GPGGA,...`, `$GPRMC,...`) encode lat/long in `DDMM.MMMM,N/S` form,
 *   which [RE_LATLON_PAIR]/[RE_LATLON_KV] do not parse. A raw NMEA dump is NOT redacted by this
 *   class.
 * - **Bluetooth device names** and Wi-Fi SSIDs are free text and not pattern-matched at all; a
 *   phone named "John Smith's iPhone" passes through untouched.
 * - **VIN embedded inside a longer alnum token** (no word boundary on one side, e.g. concatenated
 *   with a prefix/suffix) is missed — the regex requires a clean 17-char boundary.
 * - **Non-US phone numbers, email addresses, precise street addresses** in free-text log lines —
 *   none of these are pattern-matched.
 * - **IPv6** addresses are not matched at all.
 * - A passphrase or key logged in a format other than `key=value` / `key: value` (e.g. split across
 *   two lines, or embedded in a JSON blob with unusual spacing this regex does not anticipate) may
 *   be missed. [RE_WPA] is deliberately permissive about the value's character class to catch the
 *   common cases, not exhaustive about the syntax. Two residual gaps in it: a value containing a
 *   space is redacted only up to that space, and `password=` is not in its key set (only the
 *   `psk`/`passphrase`/`wpa_psk`/`pre-shared-key`/`wifi_pass`/`pass` spellings are).
 * - This operates on captured *text* lines only. A binary-encoded OCBM frame dump (if one is ever
 *   logged as raw bytes rather than the JSON `CT_PHONE_IDENT` form) is not scanned for embedded
 *   MACs/identifiers at the byte level.
 *
 * Redaction is one-way by construction: the placeholder is `<REDACTED:CATEGORY:xxxx>` where `xxxx`
 * is 4 hex chars of `SHA-256(salt || category || rawValue)`, and the map from placeholder back to
 * `rawValue` is never built — only value-to-placeholder, and only for this instance's lifetime. The
 * salt is generated per export via [SecureRandom] and is not persisted or included in the output,
 * so placeholders are useless for correlation *across* two different exports, on purpose.
