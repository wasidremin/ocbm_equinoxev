/**
 * The non-media half of CarPlay audio: phone calls, Siri, alerts and navigation.
 *
 * `:9003` multiplexes every non-media stream onto one socket. Each access unit is tagged
 * `[rate u32 BE][ch u16 BE][atype u8][len u32 BE][AU]`, where `atype` is the CarPlay purpose —
 * 0 media, 1 telephony, 2 speechRecognition, 3 alert, 4 default, 5 compatibility. That byte is the
 * whole basis for
 * routing: telephony, speechRecognition and the Siri `default` downlink are ALL negotiated as
 * AAC-ELD 16 kHz mono, so without it they are byte-for-byte indistinguishable and call audio would
 * land on the assistant output — wrong volume group, wrong ducking, and a call whose volume the
 * user cannot adjust. (`ccpa_custom` carries the byte as of the matching `tag_voice` change.)
 *
 * Routing is by [AudioAttributes] usage, never by device address: GM's CarAudioService maps
 * usage → context → volume group → bus. See `docs/13_AUDIO_ROUTING.md`.

 * @param onAssistant true while Siri is speaking, false once its sink is released.
 *
 * The media track must be **paused**, not merely ducked, for the duration. Decompiled from this head
 * unit (2026-08-12): AAOS `CarVolume` V1 ranks VOICE_COMMAND *below* MUSIC, so the volume knob targets
 * whichever of the two is active — and a ducked player is still an active player. GM layers its own
 * `GMAudioService.VolumeSynchronizer` on top, which retargets a knob-MUSIC event to the active route's
 * group, but only for GM-native sources (`BUS_TCP_PROMPT` and friends). Our Siri route reports
 * `source BUS_VOICE_COMMAND, extSource BUS_EXT_NONE`, which matches no retarget rule. Net effect: every
 * knob tick landed on `groupId 5` (MUSIC) and never once on `groupId 2` (VOICE_COMMAND).
 *
 * Pausing media removes MUSIC from the active set, leaving VOICE_COMMAND as the highest-priority active
 * context — at which point GM's own popup renders it, since its `gm_car_volume_items.xml` already maps
 * usage 16 to the title "voice volume".

         * its drain rate, so a blocking write parks for at most one HAL period (~20 ms) and loses
         * nothing; the non-blocking write it replaced discarded the remainder of every AU that
         * arrived while the buffer was full, which under the A6 double-feed was every other AU.
         * A blocking write on a PAUSED or stopped track turns non-blocking and returns short
         * (`AudioTrack::obtainBuffer`: "Non-blocking if track is stopped or paused"), so `w == 0`
         * here means the focus listener paused us and discarding IS correct — counted apart from
         * real drops so a focus loss mid-turn cannot masquerade as the A6 defect. `w < 0` is
         * ERROR_DEAD_OBJECT and rebuilds, unchanged.
         *
         * Whole body under [lock]: the codec's mapped buffers and the track are both touched, and
         * [release] can arrive from `cp-voice-sweep` at any AU boundary.
