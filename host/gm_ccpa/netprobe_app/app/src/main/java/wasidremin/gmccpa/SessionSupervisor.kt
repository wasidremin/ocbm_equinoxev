// BH_WLAN_AP being clear is correct here and would be a fault elsewhere. `iap2d` is wired-CarPlay

 * Before this existed, state was implicit in which objects happened to be non-null and which threads
 * happened to be running — `OcbmProbe.client`, `CarPlayRx.running`, `liveConnections`,
 * `MainActivity.sessionUp`, `CarPlayActivity.generation`. `LinkState` looked like a state machine but
 * is a display label: written from thirteen sites, read by none. The cost of that was not tidiness.
 * It was that the app could not tell apart three situations that need opposite responses:
 *
 *  - the phone has not dialled back YET (wait),
 *  - the phone dialled back and hung up (wait ~10 s, it usually returns),
 *  - the phone can see us, answers our nudge, and will not connect (waiting is useless — escalate,
 *    and eventually tell the driver, because the only fix is on their phone).
 *
 * All three looked identical from inside `rediscoverLoop`, which is why the app's response to every
 * one of them was to redial silently forever.
