/**
 * Drive the two vehicle-state levers CarPlay exposes as pure runtime commands:
 * **`setLimitedUI`** (restrict the UI while driving, release it in Park) and **`setNightMode`**
 * (follow the head unit's day/night theme).
 *
 * ## Why this can exist at all
 * Both are `/command` messages on the live event channel — **no reconnect, no `/info` change, no SETUP
 * feature negotiation** (`receiver::events::send_set_limited_ui` / `send_set_night_mode`). That is the
 * whole reason this feature is cheap: it binds to a session that is already streaming and cannot
 * disturb pairing, capability negotiation, or the advert. If either had needed an `/info` key we would
 * be re-pairing every phone on the rig to test it.
 *
 * The macOS host drives the same two receiver functions over OCBM (`CMD_LIMITED_UI_ON`/`_OFF`), and
 * `carlink_native` drives night mode with the OLD Carlinkit adapter opcodes (16/17) — both because the
 * box owns the CarPlay session in those designs. Here the app IS the receiver, so both go straight
 * through JNI and the box is not involved.
 *
 * ## Sources, and why these ones
 *
 * **Night — `Configuration.uiMode`.** No permission, no Car API. Identical signal to
 * `carlink_native`'s Compose `isSystemInDarkTheme()`, which is device-proven on the old firmware.
 * `MainActivity` and `CarPlayActivity` both declare `uiMode` in `configChanges`, so a theme toggle
 * arrives as `onConfigurationChanged` WITHOUT recreating the activity — that is the precondition, and
 * it is already met; do not remove `uiMode` from either manifest entry.
 *
 * **Drive — `GEAR_SELECTION`, falling back to `CarUxRestrictions`.** Measured on gminfo38
 * (2026-09-08), the permission that gates gear is the reason this is possible at all:
 *
 * | Permission | Protection | Usable here |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `CAR_POWERTRAIN` (gear) | **`normal`** | yes — install-time, no prompt, no privilege |
 * | `CAR_SPEED` | `dangerous` | yes, but runtime-granted and not needed |
 * | `CAR_DRIVING_STATE` | `signature\|privileged` | **NO** |
 *
 * So `CarDrivingStateManager` — which gives the cleanest `PARKED/IDLING/MOVING` — is out of reach for
 * an unprivileged app in `/data/app`, and reading it from `dumpsys` is not something the app can do.
 * `GEAR_SELECTION` (`0x11400400`) is reachable and was observed live on this vehicle with the gear set
 * including `GEAR_PARK` and `GEAR_DRIVE`, so it is a real signal rather than a declared stub.
 *
 * `CarUxRestrictionsManager` needs **no permission whatsoever** and is the fallback: it reports
 * `isRequiresDistractionOptimization`, observed flipping true in the same instant as the shift out of
 * Park. It is second only because it answers a slightly different question — "should the UI be
 * distraction-optimised", which is policy — where the ask here was specifically about gear.
 *
 * ## Failure posture
 * Every Car API touch is wrapped: `android.car` is a `required="false"` shared library, so on a head
 * unit without it the class loader throws `NoClassDefFoundError` at first use rather than at install.
 * A missing Car API degrades to **night-mode-only** and logs it once. Nothing here may ever take down
 * a CarPlay session — a vehicle-state lever failing is a cosmetic loss; the session is the product.
 *
 * ## Threading
 * `NativeCore.setLimitedUI`/`setNightMode` BLOCK on the global event mutex, and Car callbacks arrive
 * on the main looper, so every native call is handed to the single-thread `cp-vehicle` executor.
 * Serialising on one thread also makes the last write win, which is what we want when a gear change
 * and a theme change land together.
