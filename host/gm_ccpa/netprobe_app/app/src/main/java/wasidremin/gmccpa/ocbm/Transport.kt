 * The transport seam — a Kotlin port of the macOS host's `RawBulkTransport` protocol shape.

 * Four methods, no platform types. Everything above this line (framing, the client state machine,
 * the MFi relay) compiles and runs against [FakeTransport] with no adapter and no emulator, and
 * graduating the client into a product app is a file move rather than a rewrite.
