/**
 * Registers the app as an AAOS **media source**, and publishes the CarPlay now-playing state to it.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * AAOS does not decide "this app plays audio, therefore it is a media source". It enumerates media
 * sources by querying for services that answer `android.media.browse.MediaBrowserService`. Without one,
 * the app plays audio perfectly and is still invisible to the source switcher and the homescreen Media
 * card — selecting FM then has no way back to us except relaunching the app by hand.
 *
 * This is not theoretical: with the service registered, `dumpsys car_service` shows
 * `Current playback media component: wasidremin.gmccpa/.av.CarPlayMediaBrowserService` and six controllers
 * subscribed to the session below (device-observed 2026-09-08). They were being answered with a
 * constant title "CarPlay" and `STATE_STOPPED` while HEVC and AAC were streaming; this class now
 * answers them with what the phone actually reports.
 *
 * ## Framework class, not the AndroidX one
 *
 * This extends the platform's `android.service.media.MediaBrowserService`, NOT
 * `MediaBrowserServiceCompat`. `tools/build_apk.sh` compiles against `android.jar` + `kotlin-stdlib`
 * only — there is no AndroidX on the classpath and no Gradle dependency resolution — so the compat
 * class is unavailable. The framework class has answered the same intent action since API 21 and AAOS
 * accepts it; the compat library's value is pre-21 support and Media3 features we do not use.
 *
 * ## Deliberately not browsable
 *
 * CarPlay is a projection surface: the media library lives on the phone and is drawn by the phone. So
 * [onLoadChildren] returns an empty list. That is a legitimate media source — AAOS shows it as a source
 * with playback controls rather than a browse tree. Returning `null` instead would make AAOS treat the
 * connection as failed and drop us from the source list.
 *
 * A real browse tree would need iAP2 `MediaLibraryUpdate` (0x4C04), which is `Tier::Capability` and so
 * requires `tier: all` — a declaration iOS has already REFUTED on the wireless tunnel arm with an
 * unrecoverable `0x1D03`. The stub is the correct end state here, not a placeholder.
 *
 * ## Where the data comes from
 *
 * The `:9004` seam ([MetadataSeam]) feeds [NowPlayingState], which calls [publish] and
 * [publishPlaybackState] here. AAOS owns THIS service's lifetime — it is constructed when Media Center
 * binds, not by us — so the seam reader cannot hold an instance. Hence the process-wide [live] weak
 * reference, the same idiom as `CarPlayActivity.live`.
