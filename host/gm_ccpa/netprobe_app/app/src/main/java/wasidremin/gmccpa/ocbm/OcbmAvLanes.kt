/**
 * One A/V generation: the seams, the audio pipes, and the threads that consume them.
 *
 * Built when `CT_SUBSCRIBE` lands, closed on `STOP` or `SEV_HOST_GONE`, never reused. Its existence is
 * also the **arming guard** — `OcbmClient` only routes A/V while it holds a non-null instance, so a
 * frame arriving before HELLO_ACK or before SUBSCRIBE is counted and dropped rather than fed to a
 * decoder with a stale or absent key.
 *
 * ## The wedge this class exists to prevent
 *
 * A/V is fed inline on the OCBM read thread, on purpose: [SeamPipe]'s blocking write IS the project's
 * closed-loop backpressure (lane backs up → USB fills → the box's read-gate stops pulling → the iPhone
 * throttles that encoder). Interposing a queue would replace a closed loop with an unbounded buffer and
 * merely move the head-of-line problem.
 *
 * That design has exactly one hazard. `HevcRenderer.consume` `break`s out of its loop on an implausible
 * seam length — a dead consumer — while the pipe is still open, and `SeamPipe.write` only returns false
 * once the pipe is **closed**. A dead consumer plus an open pipe therefore blocks the USB read thread
 * forever, taking every other channel down with it.
 *
 * The fix is ownership, not another thread: **whoever owns a pipe also owns its consumer thread and
 * closes the pipe in that thread's `finally`.** [runConsumer] is the only way to start a consumer here,
 * and it enforces exactly that.
 *
 * ## Scoping
 *
 * Audio and metadata are **session**-scoped (as in the reference implementation, where the players are
 * activity-scoped and only the video renderer is surface-scoped). Video is different: `HevcRenderer`
 * binds its Surface at construction, so its pipe and thread are **surface**-scoped and are owned by the
 * caller's video epoch. The [videoSeam] stays here because it holds the session's decrypt key —
 * see [VideoSeam.attach].
