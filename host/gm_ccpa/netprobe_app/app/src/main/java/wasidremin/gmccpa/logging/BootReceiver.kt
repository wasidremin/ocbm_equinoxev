/**
 * Starts log capture at boot, so the window before the first USB attach is covered too.
 *
 * ## This is a bonus, not the load-bearing path
 * Nothing keeps this process alive. A process started only by `BOOT_COMPLETED` holds no foreground
 * service and LMK will reap it, quite possibly within minutes and certainly long before a drive
 * starts. Do not reason about capture coverage as if this receiver guarantees it.
 *
 * Coverage is guaranteed by a different property: `logcat -d` dumps what is ALREADY in the ring
 * buffer, so [LogCapture] started at USB attach still recovers the history that predates it. The
 * trampoline is the real entry point ([wasidremin.gmccpa.UsbAttachActivity]); this
 * receiver just widens the window for free when the process happens to survive.
 *
 * Registered for `BOOT_COMPLETED`, not `LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED`: capture writes under `filesDir`,
 * which on a file-based-encryption device is credential-encrypted and not readable until the user
 * is unlocked. Starting earlier would fail to open the very first file.
