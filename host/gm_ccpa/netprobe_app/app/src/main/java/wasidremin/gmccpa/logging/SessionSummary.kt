/**
 * One greppable line per CarPlay session, so a bad drive diffs against a good one without opening
 * the 6+ GB capture that produced it.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 * A session **begins at USB attach** — the earliest event this app controls — and **ends** at clean
 * teardown, at app death, or when a new attach supersedes it (the box was unplugged and replugged, or
 * the trampoline fired again, without this app ever seeing a clean close). [begin] returns the
 * [Session] handle; callers on the OCBM reader thread, the UI thread, and the HEVC render thread feed
 * it facts as they learn them via its setters, and [end] emits the line.
 *
 * Not every session HAS an attach, though. A launcher tap, `am start`, or a task switch with the
 * adapter already plugged in brings the link up without the trampoline ever running for it, and until
 * 2026-09-10 those sessions produced no line at all — the whole 2026-09-09 truck capture, a complete
 * and successful drive, holds zero `SESSION v=` lines. Such a session begins at the **first link
 * attempt with the adapter present** ([beginLaunch], called from `OcbmProbe.runAllLocked` before it
 * starts waiting for a claim) and says so: `origin=launch`, with every attach-only fact rendered as
 * the explicit absent token rather than a plausible value. See [AttachInfo.origin]. A session that never reaches
 * [end] — killed by the platform, a native crash, a wedged heartbeat — is exactly the interesting case
 * for fault-hunting, so [end] is NOT the only way a line gets written: a superseding [begin] and a JVM
 * shutdown hook both flush a best-effort line for whatever the current session knew at that moment,
 * tagged with why it closed early (see `exit=`).
 *
 * ## Why fields are pre-verdicted
 * `docs`/KDoc elsewhere (`UsbAttachActivity`, `OcbmProto`) already explains what each raw value
 * MEANS — which hypothesis a `SecurityException` on the serial read kills, why `BTP_WIFI_HANDOFF` is the
 * line between a BT fault and a Wi-Fi fault. This class carries those verdicts forward as booleans
 * (`prompted=`, `reached_handoff=`, `bond_changed=`, `no_video=`) so `grep 'prompted=true' *.log` answers
 * fault 1 across a week of drives without a human re-deriving the verdict from raw fields every time.
 *
 * ## Format contract
 * One line, `SESSION v=<schema> key=value ...`, fixed field order, emitted via [ProbeLog] under the
 * `sess` subsystem tag (so the full line in logcat reads `[sess ] SESSION v=1 id=... ...`). Absent data
 * is always an explicit token (`none`, `unknown`) — never a dropped key — because a missing field would
 * be indistinguishable from a real zero, and this whole exercise is about not fooling the next reader.
 * The field SET and ORDER are a versioned contract (`v=`): grow it by bumping [SCHEMA_VERSION] and
 * appending fields, never by reordering or repurposing an existing key, since these lines get diffed
 * across weeks of captures.
 *
 * Schema history:
 *  - `v=1` (2026-08-26): the original field set, `id=` … `exit=`.
 *  - `v=2` (2026-09-10): `origin=` appended at the end (`usb_attach` | `launch`); `perm_trampoline=`
 *    may now read `none` (a launch-origin session had no trampoline to sample). No key moved or
 *    changed meaning: a `v=1` reader that ignores unknown trailing keys still parses a `v=2` line, and
 *    `perm_trampoline=none` is the same absent-token rule every other field already follows.
 *
 * A lower-frequency `SESSION_DETAIL id=<id> ...` block (session-end only, one key per line) carries the
 * fields too long or too structured for one line: the raw phone-identity JSON and the two `MGMT_INFO`
 * bonded-device snapshots, verbatim and as parsed lists.
 *
 * `phone_device_id=` is the iPhone's BR/EDR MAC lifted from `CT_PHONE_IDENT`; it and the raw
 * `SESSION_DETAIL` JSON blocks are deliberately NOT redacted here — the export-time redactor
 * (`LogExport.kt`) is expected to find them by these key names.
 *
 * ## Thread safety / cost
 * Scalar facts are `@Volatile`; the two small, rare collections (session-event history, at most a few
 * events per session) are synchronized. Nothing here is touched by the A/V hot path — [Session.onAvFinal]
 * takes three already-computed `Long`s at teardown, exactly the "read counters at session end" the decoder
 * already does in its own `stop()` log line.
