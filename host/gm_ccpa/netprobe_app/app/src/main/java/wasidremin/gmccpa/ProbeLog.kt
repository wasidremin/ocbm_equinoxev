/**
 * Logging for the whole instrument.
 *
 * **One logcat tag — `NETPROBE`** — so a single `adb logcat -s NETPROBE` captures the app's own
 * narrative with nothing missing. The tag is written from Rust as well (`native/carplay-jni/src/lib.rs`)
 * and grepped by `tools/tri_capture.sh`, so it must not be renamed. Inside that stream the
 * **subsystem** is a fixed-width bracketed field at the start of the line (`[ocbm]`, `[cprx ]`,
 * `[trace]`, …): `grep '\[cprx \]'`.
 *
 * ## How problems are actually pulled out of a capture
 *
 * The severity axis alone is NOT how. This KDoc used to say `adb logcat -s NETPROBE:W` isolates the
 * problems, and on the 2026-09-09 reference capture that filter returned seven lines — three of them
 * `*** MILESTONE` success markers — from a session that contained a 15 s MFi sign timeout, 42 dropped
 * Siri access units and six media underruns. Everything that went wrong was narrated at `I`.
 * Severity is now held to one rule — a fault is `E`, a degraded-but-working condition is `W`,
 * narration is `I` — and the thing that makes a capture answer "what went wrong" is
 * [wasidremin.gmccpa.logging.SessionTrace]: an expected step that never arrives is printed as
 * `!! EXPECTED-MISSING <step> — <the precondition that was observed>` at `E`, and the standing state
 * of every long-lived component is printed as `## STATUS` blocks. So:
 *
 *  - `grep 'EXPECTED-MISSING\|EXPECTED-LATE'` — steps that did not happen, or nearly did not;
 *  - `grep '## STATUS'` — what was up at any moment, from the nearest block;
 *  - `grep ' E NETPROBE'` — faults, now that `E` means fault.
 *
 * ## Two filters, not one — the app is more than its own tag
 *
 * `grep NETPROBE` is the app's *narrative*, but it is not the app's *activity*. On the reference
 * capture the app's PID emitted ~250 further lines under framework tags — `CCodec`, `CCodecConfig`,
 * `CCodecBuffers`, `MediaCodec`, `BufferQueueProducer`, `ViewRootImpl[CarPlayActivity]`,
 * `SurfaceUtils` — and those are exactly the lines that decide whether a decode problem is ours or
 * the platform's. They are attributable only by PID, which is why [identity] prints one at startup.
 * The recipe, on a generic `adb logcat > logcat.log`:
 *
 * ```
 * grep NETPROBE logcat.log                          # the app's own narrative
 * PID=$(grep -m1 'IDENTITY pid=' logcat.log | grep -o 'pid=[0-9]*' | cut -d= -f2)
 * awk -v p="$PID" '$3==p' logcat.log               # everything this process caused, framework included
 * ```
 *
 * The second filter is the one that keeps the whole-OS capture honest: it shows the app's lines in
 * order with the platform's, so the capture "ALSO maintains logs of other system processes" and
 * can still be cut down to what the app did.
 *
 * Using several *tags* was the obvious alternative and is worse in practice — logcat's `-s` filterspec
 * has no tag wildcard, so every new subsystem would have to be added to every command line, and
 * forgetting one silently drops output.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO on-screen mirror of this stream. A `mirror` hook used to be declared here
 * and documented as feeding an on-screen report — but nothing ever assigned it and no such view exists,
 * so every failure the KDoc promised would reach the driver ("native core unavailable", "advert did not
 * start", "connect-out: 10 attempts with no usable response") in fact reached logcat only. Rather than
 * leave a hook that reads as implemented, the driver-facing channel is the one that actually renders:
 * `Ui.setState`/`setDetail`, driven by [SessionSupervisor] with one sentence per phase.
