/**
 * The merged now-playing picture assembled from the `:9004` metadata seam.
 *
 * ## Records are DELTAS — this is the whole reason the class exists
 * `metadata.rs:19` states the prerequisite outright: *the updates are DELTAS — merge non-empty fields
 * (an elapsed-only frame must not blank the title)*. iOS sends a full record on a track change and then
 * roughly 2 Hz frames carrying only `elapsedMs`; device-observed here on 2026-09-08 as 543 twelve-byte
 * `0x5001 NowPlayingUpdate` messages against a single 78-byte one. Publishing each record verbatim
 * would blank the title and artist twice a second — a merge bug that presents as a metadata bug.
 *
 * Every field is therefore MERGED, never replaced, and fields are cleared only on an inferred track
 * change, because iAP2 sends no "new track" marker.
 *
 * ## Wire keys
 * `metadata.rs:333-418`: title, artist, album, genre, composer, appName, durationMs, elapsedMs,
 * trackNumber, trackCount, discNumber, discCount, queueIndex, queueCount, shuffleMode, repeatMode,
 * playbackStatus, playbackSpeed, artworkId. Only the subset an AAOS media card renders is kept.
