/**
 * The two things a capture of this app could not previously answer: **what is supposed to happen
 * next**, and **what is running right now**.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `05_SESSION_FLOW.md` §8 lists nine ordering rules that kill a session, and the property they
 * share is that **every one of them fails silently**. A stream type answered with silence, a
 * `streamID` of zero, an RCS frame with the wrong 4CC, a feature negotiated but not backed — none
 * of these produce an error on either side. The 2026-09-09 capture makes the same point from the
 * other direction: 641 app lines, of which 7 were `W` and 0 were `E`, in a session that contained a
 * 15 s MFi timeout, 42 dropped Siri access units and 6 media underruns. Everything that went wrong
 * was *printed*, and nothing was *flagged*.
 *
 * A log that narrates success is not a diagnostic. What an operator needs from
 * `adb logcat > logcat.log` on a truck with no laptop attached is:
 *
 *  - **the negative space** — "RECORD completed, so a screen stream was expected within 10 s, and
 *    it never arrived", not merely the absence of a `SETUP` line among six hundred others;
 *  - **the standing state** — which sinks, seams, adverts and listeners are up at this instant,
 *    without reconstructing it from forty lines of history.
 *
 * [expect] provides the first. [Board] provides the second.
 *
 * ## Why one shared primitive rather than a timer per subsystem
 *
 * There are already nineteen `*_MS` constants across `av/`, `ocbm/` and `CarPlayRx`, and almost all
 * of them are retry or backoff intervals — the app is full of code that waits, and nearly empty of
 * code that reports having waited in vain. Left to grow organically each subsystem would spell its
 * own absence differently and none would be greppable as a class. One vocabulary, one severity
 * rule, one string prefix.
 *
 * ## Cost, and why it is safe on the A/V path
 *
 * One shared daemon scheduler, no thread per expectation. [expect] and [met] are a
 * `ConcurrentHashMap` put/remove plus a `schedule`, so they are safe to call from the OCBM reader
 * thread, the `cp-*` seam threads and the main looper alike. Nothing here blocks, and nothing here
 * is on a per-frame path — expectations are per phase, per stream, per session. A missed
 * expectation costs one log line, and a met one costs none unless it was late.
