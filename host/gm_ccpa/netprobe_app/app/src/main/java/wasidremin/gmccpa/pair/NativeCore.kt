/**
 * The JNI door to the proven CarPlay receiver core (`ccpa_custom`'s `receiver`/`pairing`/`rtsp`/`mfi`).
 *
 * Kotlin owns the control TCP connection and hands raw bytes through [feed]; everything on the other
 * side — the RTSP state machine, SRP-6a, the Ed25519/X25519 pairing API 32 cannot do, the
 * ChaCha20-Poly1305 channel, `/auth-setup`, SETUP/RECORD — is the ported implementation, not a
 * rewrite.
 *
 * The Kotlin SRP-6a in [SrpServer] stays in the tree: it independently proved pair-setup wire
 * compatibility against a real iPhone, which the reference itself flags as unprovable offline. It is
 * no longer on the session path.
