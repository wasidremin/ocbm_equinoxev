/**
 * A **CarPlay-identity** AirPlay receiver — the successor to the feasibility-era `AirPlayRx` probe
 * (now removed).
 *
 * That probe advertised `model=AppleTV3,2` with `features=0x5A7FFFF7,0x1E`, whose high word lacks
 * **bit 32 (Car)**, so iOS engaged it as an Apple TV doing Screen Mirroring. This one presents the
 * production CCPA identity — `features=0x44440B80,0x61` = **Car(32) | CarPlayControl(37) |
 * HKPairing(38)** — so iOS engages the CarPlay path instead.
 *
 * Two things are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:
 *
 *  1. **Discovery is bidirectional.** Advertising `_airplay._tcp` is not enough. The accessory also
 *     browses `_carplay-ctrl._tcp`, finds the phone, and dials it with `GET /ctrl-int/1/connect`.
 *     Only then does the phone open the control connection *inbound*. Without that nudge, nothing
 *     happens no matter how correct the advert is.
 *  2. **TXT `features` must equal `/info` `features`**, and TXT `deviceid` / `pi` must equal the
 *     receiver's, or pair-verify fails later.
 *
 * This probe stops where the crypto begins. `pair-setup` (SRP-6a) and `pair-verify`
 * (Curve25519/Ed25519) need primitives the API-32 platform does not expose, which is what the JNI'd
 * Rust core exists for. Everything up to that point — discovery, the connect-out, the inbound
 * control connection, `/info`, and which requests iOS actually issues on the CarPlay path — is
 * observable here, and none of it has been observed before.
