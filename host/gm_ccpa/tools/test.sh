# protocol crates. No hardware needed. Run before packaging any APK.

# The vendored crates are path deps, not members of the carplay-jni workspace, so they must be tested
# from their own directories. receiver must be built with --no-default-features --features mic-uplink
# to dodge the eld-codec / fdk-aac feature-unification trap (docs/06 §5d).
# Repo-relative roots. This project lives at ccpa_custom/host/gm_ccpa, so the tools resolve both
# roots from their own location rather than hard-coding an absolute path — moving the checkout, or
# having a second one, must not silently build against the wrong tree.

# something — at the moment the new file is written, which is the only moment anyone has the context
# to decide. Raw per-session captures belong in evidence/, not docs/.

# --- OCBM protocol conformance -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This app's Kotlin client and the box's `crates/ocbm-proto` are two ends of one wire. Nothing
# structural stops them drifting: the constants are hand-maintained on both sides, and a value that
# disagrees is not a compile error anywhere — it is a frame the other end misreads at runtime.
#
# ccpa_custom's checker parses ocbm-proto as canonical and diffs every client against it — this app's
# OcbmProto.kt is an app-owned fork (2026-09-11, no longer a symlink into CarlinkAndroid), so it is a
# real third client and the checker covers it with no arguments. A value disagreement is an error; a
# constant this app has not defined is a GAP and only fails for the core set (channel ids, CT_*
# opcodes, frame flags). The 2 gaps reported for THIS client today are correct and expected:
# CMD_VIEW_AREA (0x11) is a box-side opcode this app never drives — its view areas are requested by
# iOS directly over AirPlay (CarPlayActivity "requestViewArea"), never through the box's CH_INPUT —
# and F_BOTH is a client-side convenience alias for F_SOM|F_EOM that ocbm-proto has no need to name.
# (The pre-fork count quoted here was 57, from back when this path resolved through CarlinkAndroid's
# copy and the checker's totals covered every client at once.)
#
# SKIPPED, not failed, when the checker is absent (a gm_ccpa subtree exported on its own must stay
# buildable). No root argument: the checker rejects one since 2026-09-11.
