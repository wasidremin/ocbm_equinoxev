# --version-code when the manifest carries none, so the attributes were removed from AndroidManifest.xml
# on 2026-09-11 to hand this script the authority. The code is the commit count, which is monotonic

# state file, and cannot collide. The name carries the sha so `dumpsys package wasidremin.gmccpa` names the
# exact sources on the unit — which a pinned 7/"4.0" never could.
#
# COST, accepted deliberately: older artifacts in apk/ are all versionCode 7, and this APK is NOT
# debuggable, so `adb install -d` cannot roll back to one. Rolling back needs
# `adb uninstall -k wasidremin.gmccpa` first — the -k matters, a plain uninstall wipes carplay_peers.bin and
# leaves the box's BR/EDR bond asserting a pairing the app no longer has (the split brain
# BoxAction.FORGET_PHONE exists to repair). Do not "fix" this by marking the app debuggable: on API 32
# `adb backup` eligibility for a non-privileged app is decided by FLAG_DEBUGGABLE, not allowBackup, so
