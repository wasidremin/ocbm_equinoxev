# GM CCPA — Direct-WiFi CarPlay on a 2024 Silverado (GM Info 3.7 / Y181) — Findings

**Question:** Can a non-privileged, sideloaded Android app on the GM head unit act as a self-contained
wireless-CarPlay receiver — the iPhone streaming CarPlay to the app directly over the vehicle Wi-Fi
hotspot, with a Carlinkit CPC200-CCPA adapter (USB/OCBM) doing only Bluetooth + MFi?

**Answer: Yes, and it is device-proven end to end.** The feasibility case below (2026-07-31) proved
every access boundary individually. Full A/V — pairing, HEVC video, AAC-LC audio, alongside GM's own
unmodified CarPlay service — is a working, repeatable session as of 2026-08-12; the current session
mechanics, live failure points and log signatures are the *living* document,
[`12_OBSERVED_FLOW.md`](12_OBSERVED_FLOW.md). This document is the static findings record: what was
proven, the access boundaries, the codec inventory, and the two dated investigations (session-management
rejection, wireless video framing) that were fully resolved and are kept here as settled protocol facts.

Target: `gm/full_gminfo37_gb/gminfo37:12/W231E-Y181.3.2-SIHM22B-499.3/231:user/release-keys`,

## 1. Scorecard — feasibility probe (device-proven, captures 2026-07-31)

| Question | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Install as ordinary app, Play-attributed | ✅ | uid 1010124, `installerPackageName=com.android.vending` |
| In-motion display eligible | ✅ | `distractionOptimized=true` + `canDrawOverlays=true`; CarUxRestrictions readable |
| Hotspot band | ✅ 5 GHz | `SoftAp mBand:2` (BAND_5GHZ), SSID `myChevrolet 32D4`, br0 |
| AP client isolation | ✅ none | app completed TCP to the iPhone; app also runs *on* the AP host |
| Multicast / mDNS both ways | ✅ | iPhone `Owner-iPhone` discovered on br0; app's own `_airplay._tcp` REGISTERED |
| Unicast reach to iPhone | ✅ | TCP 62078 + 49152 OPEN, ICMP true — both runs |
| App reads SoftAP SSID/pass | ❌ | `SecurityException` (getSoftApConfiguration) + `EACCES` (hostapd.conf) |
| App reaches MFi / i2c | ❌ | `/dev/i2c-{0,1}` → `EACCES` (untrusted_app SELinux domain) |
| No OS blocker on the AirPlay path | ✅ | iPhone: discover → connect → `GET /info` → `POST /pair-setup` M1, against an ordinary app UID |

The two ❌ rows are design inputs, not blockers: the passphrase is entered by the user from the OS
hotspot GUI (§4), and the MFi coprocessor stays behind the CCPA, reached over USB/OCBM (§5). Both are
current architecture, not workarounds — see `12_OBSERVED_FLOW.md` Phase 0–3.

### AirPlay receiver probe (evidence 04) — the decisive protocol test

A diagnostic `_airplay._tcp` receiver (`AirPlayRx.kt`, port 7010, no pairing implemented) was advertised;
the iPhone (`AirPlay/980.71.1`) discovered it, connected, ran `GET /info`, and sent a real 32-byte
`pair-setup` M1 body — against an ordinary app UID, with no SELinux/permission/network interference
anywhere on the path. That session was Screen Mirroring, not CarPlay (the probe advertised
`model=AppleTV3,2` without the Car feature bit), so the CarPlay-specific discovery path was not yet
exercised here — but transport, HTTP and RTSP framing are identical either way, and both have since been
confirmed live (`12_OBSERVED_FLOW.md` Phase 4–6).

**`AirPlayRx.kt` is historical** — it was deleted (`11_HARDENING_PLAN.md` T6.1, LANDED). Its successor
is `CarPlayRx.kt`, which defaults to port **7011**, not 7010 (the `port` constructor default of `class CarPlayRx`, `CarPlayRx.kt`), and — unlike the probe
above — does implement pairing. **Scoped precisely 2026-09-10; this sentence used to claim
`CarPlayRx.kt` implements "SRP-6a `pair-setup`/`pair-verify`", which overstates the Kotlin side.**
What `CarPlayRx` itself implements is SRP-6a **`pair-setup` M1–M4 only** (`CarPlayRx.handlePairSetup`,
dispatched from the `/pair-setup` arm of `CarPlayRx.respond`); `handlePairSetup`'s own KDoc records
that M5/M6, the Ed25519 LTPK exchange, are not implemented there, and `respond` routes only
`/pair-setup` and `/info` — everything else, **`/pair-verify` included**, falls to its deliberate 501
arm. Pair-verify on the shipping path is done by the JNI'd Rust core via `CarPlayRx.handleNative`,
which is the whole reason the core exists (API 32 exposes no X25519/Ed25519). The Kotlin stub is a
fallback that cannot complete a session. "No pairing implemented" describes the 2026-07-31 probe
only, not the current receiver.

What this probe did **not** establish, since it matters for read order: `pair-setup` and `pair-verify`
are chipless SRP-6a / Curve25519 — the MFi coprocessor is not touched until `auth-setup`, two steps
later. The probe stopped at "no pairing implemented," not at an MFi wall.

## 2. Network topology

The head unit **hosts** the hotspot; it is not a Wi-Fi station. That fact explains several "blank"
readings and shapes the whole design.

```
              iPhone  ── Wi-Fi 5GHz ──►  br0 (SoftAP "myChevrolet 32D4", 192.168.5.1/24, HEAD UNIT)
        192.168.5.206                     │  the receiver APP runs HERE, on the AP host
   fe80::c5f:9f98:aee2:3a4f%br0           │  → host↔client, so ap_isolate never applies
                                          │
   default route = CELLULAR (net 100/101, iface vlan5, validated=false)  ← OnStar/telematics
   internal VLANs: vlan5/eth0 192.168.1.0/24 (radio) · vlan4 172.16.4.0/24 (EOCM/telematics)
```

- `WifiManager.connectionInfo` is blank (SSID `<unknown>`, ip 0.0.0.0, freq -1) because the unit is the
  AP, not a client. Band comes from `dumpsys wifi` SoftAp (`mBand:2`), not the station API.
- The default network is cellular, so *internet* sockets egress cellular — but the iPhone sits on br0's
  directly-connected route, reachable without binding (proven).
- The app runs on the AP host, so client isolation is moot: isolation blocks client↔client, never
  host↔client.

> alongside the A (NSEC only when there is no link-local address). Untested in-car at the time of
> writing; if the VCU's `ip6tables` names a different bridge than `br0` this will not be enough.

## 3. Port :7000 and GM's own CarPlay receiver

- `:7000` (AirPlay/RTSP) is held by `com.gm.domain.server.delayed:CarplayService` — a Java system
  service (uid.system), not the `com.gm.hmi.applecarplay` HMI APK and not native Cinemo. Disabling the
  CarPlay HMI apps does not free it (proven: disabled, `:7000` still listened).
- **Do not disable `com.gm.domain.server.delayed`.** It also holds REBOOT / SECURE_SETTINGS / OTA and
  manages GM's Bluetooth — losing it costs ADB access and the install/log path. It is not a reason to
  keep GM's stack in the data path; the CCPA uses its own BT radio and GM's stack is bypassed entirely.
- A receiver does not need `:7000` freed — it advertises its own RTSP port in its own Bonjour SRV
  record and the iPhone dials whatever is advertised.
- GM's `CarplayService` **does** advertise `CarPlay._airplay._tcp` on br0, so it is a competing
  `_airplay` surface on the hotspot. This used to look like a blocker (both records target the platform
  hostname `Android.local`, and iOS folds them into one endpoint keyed by host); it is now a **solved**
  coexistence problem — see `12_OBSERVED_FLOW.md` Phase 5 for the mechanism and the fix (a self-hosted
  mDNS advert on a hostname the app owns). GM's service stays running and untouched.
- **Re-confirmed end to end 2026-09-09.** The shipping configuration is now: OE GM CarPlay still
  latched onto its port and coexisted with, every *other* GM CarPlay/projection component disabled or
  uninstalled, and a full A/V session nonetheless achieved on **our own** radio software, our own
  ports and the box's Bluetooth + MFi. The capture bears this out — `com.gm.domain.server.delayed` is
  present and untouched, of all `com.gm.hmi.*` only `com.gm.hmi.settings` survives on user 0, and the
  session ran pair-verify → `/auth-setup` → SETUP 130/110/102 → HEVC first frame with GM live
  throughout. This is the coexistence claim's strongest evidence to date; it is no longer inference
  from a single 2026-08-12 run.

> **Reading `packages.txt` from a probe bundle — methodology trap, found 2026-09-09.** The recon
> script runs `adb shell pm list packages -f` with **no `--user`**, so it enumerates **user 0 only**.
> This app installs to user 10 and is therefore absent from its own probe's package list. Do NOT
> conclude "package X was removed" from that file: on the 2026-09-09 bundle it makes
> `com.android.vending`, `com.gm.hmi.connection`, `com.gm.updater` and others look uninstalled when
> the only thing established is that they are not on user 0. Use `pm list packages --user 10` (and
> `--user 0`) explicitly, or `dumpsys package <pkg>` and read the per-`User N: installed=` lines, as
> `pkg_detail.txt` does correctly for `wasidremin.gmccpa`. Fix the recon script before the next capture.

## 4. Access boundaries (settled with device proof)

- **SoftAP passphrase is unreadable by app *and* shell.** App: `getSoftApConfiguration` /
  `getWifiApConfiguration` → `SecurityException`; `hostapd.conf` → `EACCES`. Shell: `hostapd.conf`
  denied, no `cmd wifi` read. The app's own hosted AP does not even appear in its own
  `getScanResults`. ⇒ user types the passphrase in.
- **MFi coprocessor is unreachable by the app.** `/dev/i2c-0` (`saturnhd_device`) and `/dev/i2c-1`
  (`i2c_device`) are world `crw-rw-rw-` at DAC, but SELinux (Enforcing) denies the app's `untrusted_app`
  domain → `EACCES`. adb cannot relabel an app's SELinux domain without root. ⇒ MFi stays on the CCPA,
  reached over USB/OCBM (endpoints IN `0x81` / OUT `0x01`, hardware-confirmed and interface-discovered
  — `native/carplay-jni`, the class KDoc of `UsbBulkTransport`, `netprobe_app/.../ocbm/UsbBulkTransport.kt`).
- **In-motion display** requires Play-attributed install (`adb install -i com.android.vending`) *and*
  `distractionOptimized` on the activity. The shell override (`cmd car_service`) is blocked on this
  `user` build (`SecurityException: requires non-user build`), so this is the only path. Both
  preconditions are confirmed; the in-motion behaviour itself (as opposed to eligibility) has not been
  re-tested since — every capture to date was taken parked (`requiresDistractionOptimization=false`).

## 5. Media codecs (Intel HD 505 Gen9 — raw dump in `evidence/05_codecs.txt`, archive at
`~/Documents/carlink/old/gm_ccpa/evidence/` — not under this tree; see §9)

**Video — all hardware-decoded, max 3840×2160 @ up to 40 Mbps, each with a `.secure` DRM variant:**

| Codec | HW decode | HW encode | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| H.264 / AVC | ✅ `OMX.Intel.hw_vd.h264` | ✅ `hw_ve.h264` | CarPlay baseline video |
| HEVC / H.265 | ✅ `OMX.Intel.hw_vd.h265` | ✅ `hw_ve.h265` | halves Wi-Fi bitrate — this is the codec actually negotiated (see §6) |
| VP8 / VP9 | ✅ | VP9 sw only | |
| VC-1 / WMV | ✅ | — | |
| AV1 | ❌ software only (`c2.android.av1`) | — | not used by CarPlay |

`blocks-per-second` 972000 ⇒ 1080p60 with headroom, 4K30. Render target is the panel's 2400×960@60, so
the decoders are never the bottleneck.

**Audio — CORRECTED 2026-09-09: there is NO hardware audio codec on this unit, for any format.**
This section previously said AAC-LC and AAC-ELD decode and encode were "both native", which reads as
hardware. They are not. A full `dumpsys media.player` enumeration
(`gmccpa_probe_20260909_225421/codecs.txt`) lists every audio decoder on the unit as the AOSP
software set — `c2.android.{aac,mp3,flac,opus,vorbis,amrnb,amrwb,g711,raw}.decoder` plus their
`OMX.google.*` twins — and every audio encoder likewise. The only vendor codec XMLs in the firmware
are `media_codecs_google_audio.xml` and `media_codecs_google_video.xml`; the hardware entries in
`media_codecs.xml` are **video only** (`OMX.Intel.hw_vd.h264/h265/vp8/vp9`). Confirmed in a live
session: both AAC-LC media and AAC-ELD Siri decoded on `c2.android.aac.decoder`.

Three consequences, all load-bearing:

- There is also **no compressed-audio offload**. The only output flags in
  `/vendor/etc/audio_policy_configuration.xml` are `AUDIO_OUTPUT_FLAG_PRIMARY` and
  `AUDIO_OUTPUT_FLAG_DIRECT|AUDIO_OUTPUT_FLAG_VOIP_RX`; there is no `COMPRESS_OFFLOAD` mixPort, so a
  bitstream can never reach the DSP. Every CarPlay sample is CPU-decoded, and the 16 kHz mono voice
  streams are CPU-resampled to the 48 kHz stereo the buses declare
  ([`13_AUDIO_ROUTING.md`](13_AUDIO_ROUTING.md) §1).
- The hardware that does exist is the **Harman DSP behind the audio HAL, and it is strictly
  post-PCM**: bus summing, HAL ducking (`Use hal ducking signals true`), EQ. It never sees a frame.
- The mic uplink's AAC-ELD **encoder** therefore cannot come from the platform — `c2.android.aac.encoder`
  has no ELD profile. That is why the JNI `.so` cross-builds and statically links libfdk-aac
  (`13_AUDIO_ROUTING.md` §4); it is a requirement, not an optimisation.

What was right in the original claim: **no ALAC and no Dolby decoder of any kind.** Neither matters:
CarPlay's audio
ceiling is stereo AAC-LC 48 kHz, a wire-format limit set by Apple's `kAirPlayAudioFormat_*` bitmask
(flat codec × rate × channels, no entry above 2ch, no ALAC/AC-3/E-AC-3/object-based). Across all five
CarPlay WWDC sessions (2016 ×2, 2017, 2019, 2023) there are zero mentions of Atmos, spatial, surround,
multichannel, lossless or bit depth; the codec story is three sentences in `wwdc2016-722.txt:80-82`.

Two levers exist that are about delivery, not fidelity: stream type 102 for high-latency media (keeps
Apple Music off the low-latency voice path), and `mainBuffered` — a head-unit-side 2-minute buffer fed
faster than real time, which survives a Wi-Fi glitch (`wwdc2023-10150.txt:136-142`). For media crossing
5 GHz to a moving vehicle, `mainBuffered` is the more valuable of the two, and is what
`12_OBSERVED_FLOW.md` Phase 6 shows negotiated live.

Full enum, WWDC quotes and Simulator symbol evidence: `ccpa_custom/docs/carplay/06_AV_PIPELINE.md`;
stream types in `05_SESSION_FLOW.md` §6, §8 rule 10.

**Build implication (realized):** `MediaCodec` + the Intel HW decoder feeding a `Surface`. HEVC is what
is actually negotiated with the iPhone in every proven session (`12_OBSERVED_FLOW.md` Phase 7:
`OMX.Intel.hw_vd.h265`, `csd-0` = VPS+SPS+PPS). See §6 for the framing detail that made this work.

## 6. Two resolved protocol investigations (kept as settled facts)

Both of these were multi-hour investigations against a session that otherwise looked healthy. Both are
fixed and confirmed working live since 2026-08-12 (`12_OBSERVED_FLOW.md` banner at top). Kept here,
compressed, because the root causes are non-obvious protocol facts a future session could rediscover the
hard way.

### 6a. `sessionManagement` — SETUP rejected with `-16720 kFigEndpointError_InvalidParameter`

Sessions completed pairing, `/auth-setup`, SETUP and RECORD, then iOS tore the connection down ~10 ms
later. Root cause: `sessionManagementInfo` is one of six keys Apple's per-feature `/info` validator
checks for presence (`carEndpoint_validateInfoResponseKeyPresentForFeature` —
`sessionManagementInfo`, `mainBufferedInfo`, `fileTransferInfo`, `vehicleStateProtocolInfo`,
`logTransferInfo`, `uiSyncInfo`; `ccpa_custom/docs/carplay/05_METADATA_AND_CONTROLS.md (was docs/35:157-162`)) and it was absent from this project's
static `/info` while the SETUP response still echoed `"sessionManagement"` in `features` — a
desync between the two. HEVC was ruled out separately: it gates on three independent conditions
(non-null `hevcInfo`, `hevc` in SETUP `features`, iOS streaming `hvc1`), and the first two were already
satisfied.

**Fix, confirmed on hardware:** `CARPLAY_SESSION_MGMT=1` set unconditionally in `JNI_OnLoad`
(the `std::env::set_var("CARPLAY_SESSION_MGMT", "1")` call in `JNI_OnLoad`, `native/carplay-jni/src/lib.rs`), with `/info` regenerated under that same env — a static asset
built under a different env than the running server is exactly the hazard this bug was.

**Structural gaps still open on the Kotlin/Android path** (not blocking): `arm_keepalive` TCP 3/3/3
dead-link detect (Java sockets can't express it; `android.system.Os.setsockoptInt` can),
`start_input_listener()` HID on `127.0.0.1:9110` (not started — the app advertises `hidDevices` but does
not implement it), and per-connection `build_info(&load_device_config())` (this project ships a static
`/info` asset instead). Live code sites: the doc comment above `Java_zeno_gmccpa_pair_NativeCore_nativeTouch`
and the `build_info` comment block in `JNI_OnLoad` (both `native/carplay-jni/src/lib.rs`), and the
`NOT YET IMPLEMENTED` block in `netprobe_app/app/src/main/java/wasidremin/gmccpa/CarPlayRx.kt` (search
`arm_keepalive`).

**Scope corrected 2026-09-09.** These are gaps in THIS app only, not in the reference. The native
`carplayd` daemon implements all three: `fn arm_keepalive` (`ccpa/carplayd/src/main.rs`, called per
control connection in `run_pairing_server`), `fn start_input_listener` (same file; binds `127.0.0.1:9110`,
started from `main()` before the accept loop), and `pub fn build_info` (`crates/vendor/receiver/src/info.rs`)
with `fn load_device_config` (`ccpa/carplayd/src/main.rs`) called per control connection in
`run_pairing_server`. An earlier pass on 2026-09-09 entered these as flatly "not implemented", which
was wrong about the reference; the rows now read correctly. They are tracked as OPEN rows N13-N15 in
`11_HARDENING_PLAN.md` (the `CarPlayRx.kt` comment's stale pointer to §8 of this doc is tracked as N16).

**RESOLVED 2026-09-10 — this paragraph was stale.** It used to say the `NOT YET IMPLEMENTED` wording
in the `CarPlayRx.handleNative` comment block (`CarPlayRx.kt`, search `arm_keepalive`) carried the same
error and needed a source fix. It was fixed in `8cadba4`: the block now says "both are real gaps"
scoped to the Kotlin path, and cites rows N13–N16 of `11_HARDENING_PLAN.md` plus `fn arm_keepalive`
(`ccpa/carplayd/src/main.rs`) by symbol. Row N16 records it LANDED. The former text follows for
history only —
still needs a source fix.

### 6b. Wireless VideoConfig is a QuickTime sample-description box, not a bare `avcC`/`hvcC` record

On the wired path the opcode-1 VideoConfig frame is a bare configuration record
(`configurationVersion == 1` as the first byte). On WIRELESS it is wrapped in a sample-description box
(`size, 'hvc1'/'avc1', reserved..., <nested hvcC/avcC atom>`). Parsing it as a bare record extracts no
parameter sets, decodes to 0 bytes, and produces a healthy-looking session with a permanently black
screen. Fix: `unwrap_sample_description()` in `session.rs` scans for the nested atom; bare records
(`body[0] == 1`) pass through untouched, so the wired path is unaffected.

`session.rs` is not under `host/gm_ccpa` — it lives in the external `ccpa_custom` `receiver` crate
(`crates/vendor/receiver/src/session.rs`, `fn unwrap_sample_description`), reached via the
`receiver = { path = "../../../../crates/vendor/receiver", … }` dependency in
`native/carplay-jni/Cargo.toml`. Do not hunt for it in this tree.

This bug is latent in `ccpa_custom`'s own reference implementation too — its proven wireless capture
runs `OCBM_FWD_ENC` and forwards encrypted frames to the host without ever parsing the config, so that
branch is never exercised there. This project is the first thing to decrypt on-box over wireless and
therefore the first to hit it.

**Codec confirmed by decoded NAL stream, not by negotiation:** HEVC (`hvc1`) — VPS (type 32), SPS
(33), PPS (34), then IDR (`IDR_N_LP`, type 20). Per `ccpa_custom/docs/carplay/03_SDK_GROUND_TRUTH.md` §5 the codec is never declared
in the SETUP dict; it rides in-band as the FourCC. For `MediaCodec`: MIME `video/hevc`, `csd-0` =
VPS+SPS+PPS concatenated (not the separate SPS/PPS pair H.264 uses) — confirmed live in
`12_OBSERVED_FLOW.md` Phase 7.

## 7. Target architecture (validated design)

> Canonical version: [`04_SYSTEM_MODEL.md`](04_SYSTEM_MODEL.md). This section is the evidence-side
> summary; phase-by-phase session flow lives in [`12_OBSERVED_FLOW.md`](12_OBSERVED_FLOW.md).

The CCPA is reduced to the Bluetooth radio + the MFi coprocessor, reached over USB/OCBM. It raises no
access point and carries no media; the iPhone is never wired to it.

```
 iPhone ──BT──► CCPA (own BT, NOT vehicle BT) ──USB/OCBM──► head-unit APP
   │            └ MFi coprocessor (cert + signature, relayed over OCBM every session)
   │
   └─ told to join "myChevrolet" via 0x5703 handoff (app-supplied SSID+pass) ─┐
                                                                              ▼
 iPhone (192.168.5.206) ──── 5GHz Wi-Fi, br0 ────► APP is the AirPlay endpoint (192.168.5.1)
        advertises _airplay._tcp ◄─ iPhone connects in ─► RTSP + pair-verify + H.264/HEVC stream
```

All five build tasks this section used to enumerate as future work are implemented and confirmed live:
app-held AirPlay identity + software `pair-verify`, MFi relay over OCBM `CH_MFI` (chip key never leaves
the CCPA, re-run every session — not first-pairing only), parameterized `0x5703` handoff carrying the
vehicle's own hotspot creds, BT↔Wi-Fi identity consistency, and the two independent planes post-handoff
(BT link as session anchor + OCBM for MFi relay, media on br0 directly — bypassing the ~90 Mbps USB
write cap). See `12_OBSERVED_FLOW.md` for the current phase-by-phase mechanics and open failure points.

## 8. What to protect from the debloat (`reference/debloat/gm_debloat_full.sh`)

`reference/kept_packages.txt` is the authoritative keep list (thirteen entries). Five of them collided
with the script as it stood on 2026-07-01 (byte-exact at
`git show b049810:host/gm_ccpa/reference/debloat/gm_debloat_full.sh`) — four package actions plus the
settings block that goes with three of them:

- **SoftAP disable** (former `SECTION 5: Disable Wi-Fi Hotspot / SoftAP`, plus the `--- Wi-Fi hotspot ---`
  block of `run_status_report`): wrote `tether_supported 0`, `wifi_ap_enabled 0`,
  `fid_hotspot_disable_status 1`, `share_hotspot_data_status 0`, `soft_ap_timeout_enabled 1`,
  `tethering_allow 0` (all `settings put global`, persistent across reboots), tried to kill `hostapd`
  (`cmd wifi stop-softap`, then an airplane-mode toggle), and the status report FAILED the run if
  `hostapd` was up — the very `myChevrolet` hotspot the plan needs.
- **`com.android.networkstack.tethering.inprocess`, `….tethering.inprocess.csm`, `….tethering.csm`**
  (former `TETHER_PACKAGES` array, `pm disable-user` + `am force-stop` from Section 5) — three keep-list
  entries; disabling them is what stopped `hostapd` respawning at boot.
- **`com.android.vending`** (`DISABLE_PACKAGES`, plus a per-boot `am force-stop` in former Section 7) — the
  in-motion display path checks `installerPackageName=com.android.vending`; whether a user-disabled
  installer still satisfies that check is untested on this build, so it stays enabled. Re-test in-motion
  after any debloat.
- **`com.gm.hmi.connection`** (`BLOAT_PACKAGES` — the *uninstall* list, `pm uninstall --user`, not the
  disable list; recoverable with `pm install-existing --user <u> com.gm.hmi.connection`) — hosts
  `WifiHotspotActivity`, the only GUI that can read the hotspot passphrase, which the app cannot read
  programmatically (§4). `brand.chevrolet.app.connection` stays in the uninstall list: it was removed and
  the hotspot GUI still worked.

The other eight keep-list entries (`com.google.android.gms`, `com.google.android.gsf`, `com.gm.vmsplugin`,
`com.gm.updater`, `com.gm.hmi.hvac`, `brand.chevrolet.app.hvac`, `com.google.android.embedded.projection`,
`com.gm.domain.server.delayed`) were already commented out of, or never in, the script.

**Reconciled 2026-09-10.** Section 5 (hotspot) and Section 7 (Play Store force-stop) are deleted outright,
not flag-gated — the script is meant to re-run every boot, the settings persist, and one accidental run
poisons the unit until six settings are reverted by hand. `com.gm.hmi.connection` and
`com.android.vending` are out of the action arrays. A pre-flight guard (`KEEP_FILE` / `is_kept` block,
placed after the arrays so `--status` is guarded too) reads `kept_packages.txt` and hard-fails with
exit 1 if any keep-list package appears in `BLOAT_PACKAGES` or `DISABLE_PACKAGES`;
`remove_package`/`disable_package` refuse kept packages a second time. To disable one deliberately,
delete its line from `kept_packages.txt` first. Note the copy under `old/gm_ccpa` is a *different*
2026-09-08 variant ("hotspot kept enabled; Play Store/Services/Maps removed"), not this file's ancestor.

**Revert recipe for a unit that already had Section 5 applied** — the exact inverse of the four settings
it wrote that gate the hotspot, then re-enable the three tethering packages for both users:

```
adb shell settings put global wifi_ap_enabled 1
adb shell settings put global fid_hotspot_disable_status 0
adb shell settings put global tether_supported 1
adb shell settings put global tethering_allow 1
for u in 0 10; do
  for p in com.android.networkstack.tethering.inprocess \
           com.android.networkstack.tethering.inprocess.csm \
           com.android.networkstack.tethering.csm; do
    adb shell pm enable --user $u $p
  done
done
```

Section 5 also wrote `share_hotspot_data_status 0` and `soft_ap_timeout_enabled 1`. **Their stock
values are now recorded (2026-09-09), from a unit with a working hotspot
(`gmccpa_probe_20260909_225421/settings.txt`):**

```
share_hotspot_data_status=0      # SAME as what the script wrote — never a factor
soft_ap_timeout_enabled=0        # the script wrote 1; this is the one that needs reverting
```

So the recipe above is complete except for one line — add `adb shell settings put global
soft_ap_timeout_enabled 0`. The same capture confirms the four settings the recipe already covers are
at their working values on this unit (`tether_supported=1`, `tethering_allow=1`,
`fid_hotspot_disable_status=0`, `wifi_ap_enabled` absent/unset with the hotspot up). Reboot
afterwards: the tethering packages are what start `hostapd` at boot.
